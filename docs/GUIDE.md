## What it is

beeperbox runs **Beeper Desktop** inside a Docker container, headlessly. Beeper Desktop is the official cross-platform Beeper app, and it exposes a local HTTP API (Beeper's own "Developer mode" feature) for reading chats and sending messages across every bridge Beeper supports: WhatsApp, iMessage, Signal, Discord, Slack, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, LinkedIn, and more.

Normally Beeper Desktop needs a real screen, keyboard, and a human pressing buttons. beeperbox wraps it in a virtual display (`Xvfb`), a window manager (`openbox`), and a browser-accessible VNC view (`noVNC`) so you can run it on a server, log in from anywhere via a web browser, and then use the API from any programming language that can speak HTTP.

### Who it is for (and who it is not for)

beeperbox is built for one specific situation: **autonomous agents that need messaging reach without a human at a Beeper Desktop**.

Concretely:

- AI agents running on a VPS that need to reply to customer messages
- Cron jobs that fan out notifications to your phone across multiple messengers
- Multi-tenant SaaS where each customer needs their own Beeper account behind their own agent
- Headless servers that need to send alerts to humans on whichever messenger they prefer
- Anything in a container, on a Raspberry Pi, in CI, on a remote box where you cannot keep a Desktop GUI session running

If you are a **laptop user** with Beeper Desktop installed locally, you do not need the **container** — Beeper already provides:

- A native HTTP API on `localhost:23373` (the same one beeperbox exposes inside the container)
- A built-in MCP server for AI agent runtimes like Claude Desktop and Claude Code
- A real GUI you can interact with directly

The container is the same machinery, packaged for environments where running Beeper Desktop on the host is not an option.

**One exception — lite mode.** If Beeper Desktop is already open on your machine *and* you specifically want beeperbox's opinionated 15-tool surface (the normalized schemas, the `source` echo-guard, the `poll_messages` watch primitive) instead of Beeper's raw API, run `npx beeperbox` — the same verb server, standalone, no container. See [Lite mode (run without Docker)](#lite-mode-run-without-docker).

It is **not** a bot framework, **not** an agent runtime, and **not** a general-purpose messaging gateway. It is the messaging substrate other software plugs into.

## What you get at the end

A single HTTP endpoint on your host:

```
http://localhost:23373
```

(Or `:23374` if you set `BEEPERBOX_HOST_PORT=23374` because a native Beeper Desktop on the same host already owns `:23373` — see [Ports](#ports) below.)

That endpoint:

- Speaks the [Beeper Desktop API](https://developers.beeper.com/) — an OpenAPI 3.1 spec documenting ~20 operations (list chats, get messages, send message, search, contacts, reactions, reminders, assets)
- Requires a `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header on all real operations (only `/v1/info` is public)
- Covers every messaging network you have connected to your Beeper account

Anything that can make an HTTP request can use it. Your agent framework, your Python script, your cron job, a Zapier-like no-code tool, `curl` from a terminal — they all look the same to beeperbox.

### What "every messaging network" actually means

Beeper Desktop syncs the **top ~20 most recently active chats** by default. If your beeperbox-driven agent doesn't see a chat that exists in your account, it's almost certainly because:

- The chat is older than the top-20 cutoff
- The chat is archived
- The chat hasn't received messages in long enough that Beeper deprioritized it from the live sync

Workaround: open Beeper Desktop in noVNC (`http://localhost:6080/vnc.html`), find the chat in the sidebar, and pin it. Pinned chats stay in the live sync regardless of activity. Or scroll to the chat once and Beeper will start syncing it.

For long-tail history (chats from years ago), Beeper has a separate search backend — use `/v1/messages/search` rather than `/v1/chats` to find them.

### Pairing with an existing Beeper account on your phone

You don't have to go through the bridge-pairing flow inside the container. **Bridge state lives on Beeper's servers, not on your device.** If you already have a Beeper account configured on your phone (with WhatsApp, Signal, etc. all paired), all you need to do inside beeperbox is:

1. Open noVNC
2. Sign in with the same Beeper credentials your phone uses
3. All your existing bridges show up automatically — no QR codes, no re-pairing

This means you can leave your phone as the "primary" Beeper client (where you do your normal pairing) and treat beeperbox as a read/write API replica. Both stay in sync because they're both talking to the same upstream Matrix homeserver.

## Quick setup (10 minutes, one-time)

This is the linear walkthrough from a clean machine to a working beeperbox + MCP server. Every step is mandatory, in order. After this, the rest of the guide is reference material you can dip into when you hit a specific question.

You will need: Docker installed, a Beeper account, a web browser, and ~10 minutes of attention.

### Step 1 — clone and build

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hamr0/beeperbox.git
cd beeperbox
docker compose up -d
```

First build takes ~2 minutes. When it finishes, the container is running but Beeper Desktop inside it has no login yet.

### Step 2 — open noVNC in your browser

```
http://localhost:6080/vnc.html
```

Click **Connect**. You should see a Linux desktop with Beeper Desktop starting up. If the window is grey for the first 30 seconds, that's normal — Electron is slow to start.

### Step 3 — log in to Beeper

Inside the noVNC view, log in to Beeper Desktop with your Beeper account credentials (email code, etc.). When login completes, your chat list should appear.

If you already have Beeper set up on your phone, **use the same credentials** — all your existing bridges (WhatsApp, Signal, etc.) will inherit automatically. No re-pairing.

### Step 4 — enable the local API

Inside Beeper Desktop: **Settings → Developers**

Toggle on:
- **Enable Beeper Desktop API**
- **Start API on launch** ← critical, otherwise you must repeat this step after every container restart

### Step 5 — create an access token

Still in **Settings → Developers**, scroll to **Approved Connections** and click **+** to create a new connection.

In the dialog:
- **Name** — `beeperbox-mcp` (or anything memorable)
- **Permissions** — **Allow sensitive actions** (the MCP server needs read + write)
- **Expiry** — **Never** (unless you have a token-rotation policy)

Click create. Beeper shows you a long random token string.

### Step 6 — get the token out of noVNC

noVNC clipboard sharing is unreliable. The fastest workaround: inside Beeper Desktop, **paste the token into your "Note to self" chat**. Then on your host machine, open Beeper on your phone (or any other Beeper client) and copy the token from there.

### Step 7 — save the token to a `.env` file

On your host machine, in the beeperbox directory:

```sh
printf 'BEEPER_TOKEN=PASTE-TOKEN-HERE\n' > .env
```

`.env` is in `.gitignore`, so it will not be committed accidentally.

### Step 8 — recreate the container so it picks up the token

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

**Use `up -d`, not `restart`.** `restart` does not re-read environment variables. Only `up -d` recreates the container with the new env from your `.env` file.

### Step 9 — verify everything is wired up

```sh
docker compose logs beeperbox 2>&1 | grep "beeper token"
```

You want to see:

```
[beeperbox-mcp] beeper token: set
```

If it says `NOT SET`, your `.env` file is in the wrong directory or has a typo. Re-check step 7.

### Step 10 — test the MCP server end-to-end

This is the moment of truth. Call the `list_inbox` tool through the MCP HTTP transport from your host:

```sh
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:23375 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary @- <<'EOF'
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"list_inbox","arguments":{"limit":3}}}
EOF
```

You should get back JSON with three of your most recently active chats, each carrying its `network` (whatsapp / telegram / discord / etc.), `title`, `last_message_at`, and `unread_count`. Note-to-self chats are filtered out automatically.

If you see real chats: **you are done**. beeperbox is running, the MCP server is reachable, and any AI agent runtime that speaks MCP can now consume it.

If you see an error, jump to [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

### What you can do next

- **Point an AI agent runtime at it**: Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, bareagent — any MCP client that supports stdio or HTTP transport can consume beeperbox as a tool source. Configure it once and the LLM sees up to 15 tools (`list_inbox`, `list_unread`, `poll_messages`, `read_chat`, `get_chat`, `search_messages`, `list_accounts`, `send_message`, `note_to_self`, `react_to_message`, `archive_chat`, `download_asset`, `send_draft`, `list_labels`, `update_label` — narrowed per instance by `MCP_TOOL_MODE`). See the [MCP tools reference](#mcp-tools-reference) section below.
- **Build something custom**: hit the raw Beeper API on `http://localhost:23373/v1/*` from any language with an HTTP client and your `BEEPER_TOKEN`. See [Use it — real examples](#use-it--real-examples) for curl / Node / Python snippets.
- **Deploy to a VPS**: same steps work on any Linux box with Docker. SSH-tunnel noVNC for the one-time login. See [Deploy to a VPS](#deploy-to-a-vps).

---

## Prerequisites

- **A Beeper account** — sign up at [beeper.com](https://www.beeper.com/). Free tier connects 5 platforms. No affiliation; you bring your own account.
- **Docker engine** with the Compose plugin, or a compatible runtime (Podman with `podman-docker` shim works).
- **~2 GB free disk** for the image, volume, and Beeper data.
- **~1 GB free RAM** for the running container. A $5/month VPS has enough.
- **Ports `6080` and `23373` free** on the host. If a native Beeper Desktop already runs on `:23373`, override with `BEEPERBOX_HOST_PORT=23374` — no compose edit needed (see [Ports](#ports)).
- **A web browser** reachable to the host for the one-time login step.

## Install

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hamr0/beeperbox.git
cd beeperbox
docker compose up -d
docker compose logs -f
```

First build takes ~2 minutes (downloading Debian, installing X server packages, downloading the Beeper AppImage). Subsequent builds are cached.

When you see lines like `[ok] beeper api -> http://localhost:23373` in the logs, the container is ready for step-one of the human side. You can `Ctrl-C` out of `logs -f` at any time — the container keeps running.

## First-run setup

This is the only part that needs a human at a browser. It happens **once**.

### 1. Open the noVNC web UI

In any browser:

```
http://localhost:6080/vnc.html
```

Click **Connect**. You will see a Linux desktop with Beeper Desktop starting up.

If you are running on a VPS, replace `localhost` with the VPS's IP. **If the VPS is public, see the [security notes](#security-notes) below first** — do not expose `6080` to the open internet without protecting it.

### 2. Log in to Beeper

Beeper Desktop will show its login screen. Log in with your Beeper account as you normally would — email code, or whatever method you use. When login completes, you should see your chat list.

### 3. Turn on the local API

Inside Beeper Desktop: **Settings → Developers**

Enable these two toggles:

- **Enable Beeper Desktop API**
- **Start API on launch** (crucial — otherwise you must repeat this step after every container restart)

## Create an access token

All API operations except `/v1/info` require an `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header. The MCP server inside the container also needs this token to call the local Beeper API. **You create the token once and forget it** — it persists across container rebuilds and host reboots.

### Option A — create a token manually in Beeper Desktop (recommended)

Still inside Beeper Desktop in noVNC: **Settings → Developers → Approved Connections → +**

In the dialog:

1. **Name** — call it whatever helps you remember (e.g. `beeperbox-mcp`)
2. **Permissions** — select **Allow sensitive actions** (the MCP server needs read + write to do anything useful)
3. **Expiry** — pick **Never** unless you have a specific rotation policy
4. Click create

Beeper will display the token string. It is a long random value — treat it like a password.

**Read-only vs read-write**: the **Allow sensitive actions** toggle gates write operations. With it **on**, the token can call every MCP tool including `send_message`, `react_to_message`, `archive_chat`, and `note_to_self`. With it **off**, the token is read-only — `list_inbox`, `list_unread`, `read_chat`, `get_chat`, `search_messages`, and `list_accounts` all still work, but write attempts return `401 Unauthorized`. If you want a least-privilege agent that can observe but not reply, create a second token with "Allow sensitive actions" off and point that agent at it. You can have as many tokens as you want on one Beeper account; revoke them individually from the same Approved Connections panel.

**Note**: noVNC clipboard sharing is famously unreliable. If you cannot copy the token directly out of the noVNC view, the simplest workaround is to send the token to yourself in **Note to self** inside Beeper Desktop, then copy it from there. (Or set up real noVNC clipboard integration, but the workaround is faster.)

Once you have the token on your host machine, save it to a `.env` file next to `docker-compose.yml`:

```sh
cd ~/PycharmProjects/beeperbox
printf 'BEEPER_TOKEN=PASTE-TOKEN-HERE\n' > .env
```

`.env` is in `.gitignore`, so it will not be committed accidentally. Now recreate the container so docker compose picks the new env var up:

```sh
docker compose up -d
```

(`up -d` recreates the container if its env changed. `restart` does NOT pick up new env vars — you must use `up -d`.)

Verify the MCP server now sees the token:

```sh
docker compose logs beeperbox 2>&1 | grep "beeper token"
```

You should see:

```
[beeperbox-mcp] beeper token: set
```

If it still says `NOT SET`, check that `.env` is in the same directory as `docker-compose.yml` and that the file has the literal text `BEEPER_TOKEN=...` with no quotes around the value.

**This is a one-time setup.** The token in Beeper persists until you revoke it from the same Approved Connections panel. The `.env` file persists on disk. Together they survive every kind of restart:

| Action | Token survives? |
|---|---|
| `docker compose restart` | yes |
| `docker compose down && docker compose up -d` | yes |
| `docker compose up -d --build` (image rebuild) | yes |
| Reboot the host | yes |
| Rebuild the host OS | no — recreate the `.env` file with the same token |

### Option B — OAuth2 PKCE flow (for distributable apps)

If you are building something other people will run — e.g. an installable agent, a multi-user app, a hosted SaaS — you want the OAuth2 Authorization Code flow with PKCE so each user can grant their own access without you ever seeing their token. The endpoints are discoverable at:

```sh
curl http://localhost:23373/v1/info | python3 -m json.tool
```

See `endpoints.oauth` in the response. This path is beyond the scope of this guide — see Beeper's own docs at [developers.beeper.com](https://developers.beeper.com/).

## Verify the API works

Three calls. If all three succeed, you're done and everything else in this guide is just examples.

**1. Public health probe (no token needed):**

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:23373/v1/info | python3 -m json.tool
```

Expected: JSON with `app.name: "Beeper"`, `server.status: "running"`.

**2. Authenticated call — list accounts:**

```sh
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $BEEPER_TOKEN" \
     http://localhost:23373/v1/accounts | python3 -m json.tool
```

Expected: a JSON array of your connected Beeper accounts (one per bridge — WhatsApp, iMessage, etc).

**3. List the 5 most recent chats:**

```sh
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $BEEPER_TOKEN" \
     "http://localhost:23373/v1/chats?limit=5" | python3 -m json.tool
```

Expected: a JSON array of five chats with titles, last-message timestamps, network IDs.

If **1** works but **2/3** return `401 Unauthorized`, your token is wrong — go back and regenerate it.

If **1** returns a connection error, the container isn't running or the host port isn't mapped. See [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

## Use it — real examples

All examples assume `BEEPER_TOKEN` is set and beeperbox is on `localhost:23373`.

### curl — send a message

First find a chat ID:

```sh
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $BEEPER_TOKEN" \
     "http://localhost:23373/v1/chats?limit=1" \
     | python3 -c 'import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin)[0]["id"])'
```

Then send:

```sh
curl -s -X POST \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer $BEEPER_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"text": "hello from beeperbox"}' \
     "http://localhost:23373/v1/chats/<chatID>/messages"
```

### Node (vanilla, no deps)

```js
const TOKEN = process.env.BEEPER_TOKEN;
const BASE = 'http://localhost:23373/v1';

async function listChats(limit = 10) {
  const r = await fetch(`${BASE}/chats?limit=${limit}`, {
    headers: { Authorization: `Bearer ${TOKEN}` }
  });
  if (!r.ok) throw new Error(`${r.status} ${await r.text()}`);
  return r.json();
}

async function send(chatID, text) {
  const r = await fetch(`${BASE}/chats/${chatID}/messages`, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: {
      Authorization: `Bearer ${TOKEN}`,
      'Content-Type': 'application/json'
    },
    body: JSON.stringify({ text })
  });
  if (!r.ok) throw new Error(`${r.status} ${await r.text()}`);
  return r.json();
}

const chats = await listChats(5);
console.log(chats.map(c => c.title));
await send(chats[0].id, 'hi from node');
```

### Python (vanilla stdlib, no deps)

```python
import json, os, urllib.request

TOKEN = os.environ['BEEPER_TOKEN']
BASE = 'http://localhost:23373/v1'

def request(method, path, body=None):
    req = urllib.request.Request(
        BASE + path,
        method=method,
        headers={'Authorization': f'Bearer {TOKEN}', 'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
        data=json.dumps(body).encode() if body else None,
    )
    with urllib.request.urlopen(req) as r:
        return json.loads(r.read())

chats = request('GET', '/chats?limit=5')
print([c['title'] for c in chats])
request('POST', f'/chats/{chats[0]["id"]}/messages', {'text': 'hi from python'})
```

### Search messages

```sh
curl -s -G -H "Authorization: Bearer $BEEPER_TOKEN" \
     --data-urlencode 'query=invoice' \
     http://localhost:23373/v1/messages/search | python3 -m json.tool
```

### Full endpoint list

```sh
curl -s http://localhost:23373/v1/spec \
     | python3 -c 'import json,sys; [print(p) for p in sorted(json.load(sys.stdin)["paths"])]'
```

As of Beeper Desktop 4.2.715, the endpoints are:

```
/v1/accounts
/v1/accounts/{accountID}/contacts
/v1/accounts/{accountID}/contacts/list
/v1/assets/download
/v1/assets/serve
/v1/assets/upload
/v1/assets/upload/base64
/v1/chats
/v1/chats/search
/v1/chats/{chatID}
/v1/chats/{chatID}/archive
/v1/chats/{chatID}/messages
/v1/chats/{chatID}/messages/{messageID}
/v1/chats/{chatID}/messages/{messageID}/reactions
/v1/chats/{chatID}/reminders
/v1/focus
/v1/info
/v1/messages/search
/v1/search
/v1/spec
```

### The raw `/v1/` contract (quirks the MCP layer absorbs)

If you call `/v1/*` directly instead of going through the MCP tools, you inherit the same quirks the MCP normalizers handle for you. Match these and a raw consumer behaves identically:

- **`?limit=N` is a *lower* bound, not an upper one.** `GET /v1/chats?limit=N` and `GET /v1/chats/{chatID}/messages?limit=N` return **~25 items minimum regardless of `N`**. The MCP layer over-fetches `max(N, 25)` then slices to `N` client-side — do the same; don't trust the count.
- **No server-side cursor / `since=` param.** The API is request/response only. To enumerate *new* messages since a prior poll (what `poll_messages` does internally): list chats, keep those whose `lastActivity` is `>=` your high-water timestamp, page each one's messages, keep messages whose `timestamp` is **strictly after** your cursor, and **dedup same-millisecond ties by id** (track the ids seen at the high-water timestamp — this is the off-by-one hand-rolled pollers miss). Then advance your stored `(timestamp, ids@timestamp)`. Bounded by Beeper's ~20-chat live sync, same as everything else. **Prefer the `poll_messages` MCP tool** — this recipe is only for raw consumers that can't use MCP.
- **Canonical field heuristics** (apply these to agree with the MCP `Chat`/`Message` shapes):
  - **Network** is not in the room id — resolve `chat.accountID` against `GET /v1/accounts` → `account.network`, then slug it (cache the map per session).
  - **Note-to-self** = `chat.participants.total === 1 && chat.participants.items[0].isSelf === true` (catches Beeper-native Note to self *and* each platform's saved-messages chat; `list_inbox`/`list_unread` filter these out).
  - **Group** = `chat.type === 'group'` (and not note-to-self) — there is no `isGroup` field.
  - **Last activity** = `chat.lastActivity` (camelCase ISO 8601), not `last_activity`.
  - **Sender-is-self** = `message.isSender === true` — true for anything the account sent from *any* client, so it is *not* an "I sent it via the API" signal (the `source` field the MCP layer adds is a beeperbox-side ledger with no raw-API equivalent).
  - **Sent message id** = `POST .../messages` returns `pendingMessageID`, a local pending id Beeper replaces with a real id on bridge ack — don't treat it as a stable delivered id. To get the final id, GET `.../messages/{pendingMessageID}` until its `id` differs (the swap is async); the MCP layer does this for you and returns `message_id` / `resolved`.

## MCP tools reference

beeperbox exposes 15 semantic tools over Model Context Protocol on two interchangeable transports. Any AI agent runtime that speaks MCP (Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Continue, bareagent, etc.) can consume them.

### The 15 tools

| Tool | Required | Returns | Use case |
|---|---|---|---|
| `list_accounts` | — | Array of accounts with `network` slug + `network_label` | Discover which platforms are reachable at session start |
| `list_inbox` | — | Array of `Chat` | Triage: what's happening right now |
| `list_unread` | — | Array of `Chat` (unread only) | "What needs my attention?" — primary inbox check |
| `poll_messages` | — | `{cursor, messages: Message[], has_more}` | Watch loop: "what's new since I last looked?" — passive, restart-resumable, echo-guarded |
| `get_chat` | `chat_id` | `Chat` | Refresh one chat's state before replying |
| `read_chat` | `chat_id` | Array of `Message` (oldest first) | Pull conversation context for the LLM to reason about |
| `search_messages` | `query` | Array of `Message` | Follow-up lookups, historical context, "what did X say about Y" |
| `send_message` | `chat_id`, `text` | `{chat_id, message_id, pending_message_id, resolved, client_tag, status}` | The headline reply/notify tool (optional `client_tag` echo key). `message_id` is the resolved final bridge id when `resolved: true`, else the pending id |
| `note_to_self` | `text` | same | Agent self-notes, debug output, scheduled reminders — auto-resolves to the Beeper-native Note to self chat (won't leak into per-platform saved-messages chats) |
| `react_to_message` | `chat_id`, `message_id`, `emoji` | `{...status: reacted}` | Lightweight ack, no full reply needed |
| `archive_chat` | `chat_id` | `{chat_id, archived}` | Clean handled chats out of inbox (closest primitive to mark-as-read that Beeper exposes) |
| `download_asset` | `src_url` *or* `chat_id`+`message_id` | `{src_url, content_type, bytes, encoding, data_base64, ...}` | Fetch an attachment's actual bytes (base64) — reach a media/PDF/doc file an LLM can index. Capped at `BEEPERBOX_MAX_ASSET_BYTES` (default 8 MiB) |
| `send_draft` | `chat_id` | `{chat_id, action, draft, sent: false}` | Pre-fill the human's composer for that chat (markdown → rich text). **Never sends** — the human reviews and fires (or deletes) it themselves. `clear: true` empties the draft. The human-in-the-loop approval primitive for `notes`-mode agents |
| `list_labels` | — | `{instance_label_scope, labels: [{label_id, title, chat_count, chats[]}]}` | See the user's Beeper labels (private cross-platform chat folders), which chats carry each, and what this instance's `MCP_LABEL_ALLOW` scope covers |
| `update_label` | `title` | `{label_id, title, added, removed, chat_count}` | Add/remove chats from a label, create one (unknown title + `add_chat_ids`), or `rename`. Labels are Matrix account data — invisible to contacts, nothing is sent anywhere |

### Tool modes & label scoping

One `server.js` can boot as different capability surfaces, so an operator can hand each agent exactly the instance its job deserves. Two orthogonal dials:

**`MCP_TOOL_MODE`** — which tools exist on the instance. Non-selected tools are hidden from `tools/list` **and** rejected in `tools/call`, so a client that hardcodes a name still can't reach them (covers stdio too, not just HTTP). Tools fall into four safety groups: *read* (no side effects), *self-write* (`note_to_self`, `send_draft` — mutate only your own notes or an unsent composer), *outbound-write* (`send_message`, `react_to_message`, `archive_chat` — visible to other people), *label-write* (`update_label` — private organization only).

| Mode | Surface | Typical tenant |
|---|---|---|
| `read-only` | reads only | default triage agents, anything reachable over a tunnel |
| `notes` | reads + self-write | an agent that may draft replies and jot notes but must **never** send to a third party |
| `labels` | reads + label-write | an organizer agent that curates label sets, still can't send |
| `read-write` | everything | your one trusted operator agent |

`MCP_TOOL_MODE` unset ⇒ legacy behaviour: `MCP_READ_ONLY=1` → `read-only`, else `read-write`. Unknown mode ⇒ `read-only` with a loud boot warning (fail closed).

**`MCP_LABEL_ALLOW`** — restrict *which chats* an instance can see and touch, by Beeper label. Labels are the user's cross-platform chat folders (WhatsApp + Slack + Telegram chats under one title), stored as private Matrix account data (`com.beeper.labels`), so one scope string spans every network. Set it to a comma-separated list of label titles (case-insensitive) or label ids and the instance becomes a scoped world: `list_inbox` / `list_unread` only return in-scope chats (each annotated with its `labels[]`), `search_messages` drops out-of-scope hits, `get_chat` / `read_chat` / `poll_messages` refuse out-of-scope `chat_id`s, and the write verbs (`send_message`, `react_to_message`, `archive_chat`, `send_draft`, `update_label`) enforce the same gate — an agent scoped to "Work" literally cannot message outside it. `note_to_self` is exempt (its recipient is auto-resolved to the self chat, not a third party). Enforcement fails **closed**: if a scope is configured but labels can't be resolved (Beeper mid-sync, no Beeper-native account), chat verbs error rather than leak the full inbox. Label reads are cached briefly (`BEEPERBOX_LABEL_CACHE_TTL_MS`, default 30 s) so labeling a chat in Desktop takes effect within a beat.

Compose the two dials per instance (per port + token): e.g. `MCP_TOOL_MODE=notes` for the personal assistant, `MCP_TOOL_MODE=notes MCP_LABEL_ALLOW=Preface` for the work triager, `MCP_TOOL_MODE=read-write` loopback-only for you.

#### `poll_messages` — the watch loop

A passive new-messages-since-cursor feed; the right tool for an agent that wants to *react* to incoming messages instead of repeatedly diffing `list_inbox` by hand. **Read-only** — it never marks read, archives, or mutates. First call (omit `cursor`) **seeds** from now and returns `{cursor, messages: [], seeded: true}`; pass the cursor back each subsequent call to get only newer messages plus a fresh cursor. The cursor is opaque and **restart-resumable** — persist it and resume across restarts with no missed or duplicated messages (same-millisecond messages are deduplicated by id). `has_more: true` means more is immediately fetchable — keep polling until it's `false`, then sleep. (Residual: beeperbox reads up to the newest 100 messages per chat per poll, so a chat receiving more than 100 messages between two polls can lose the oldest of that burst — Beeper's API has no backward paging; poll frequently enough, or backfill with `read_chat`.) Includes the account's own messages on purpose; branch on each message's **`source`** field (`"api"` = sent by this beeperbox, skip it; `"external"` = everything else including the owner's own Note-to-self commands) rather than `sender.is_self`, which can't tell the agent's API sends from the human's own typing. The poll interval is yours — beeperbox provides the *ability* to watch, not a *policy* about cadence.

#### `download_asset` — reach an attachment's bytes (MCP-only)

A media message (`type: "MEDIA"`) carries no usable `text` — its file lives behind the `attachments[]` array each normalized `Message` now exposes (`{type, file_name, mime_type, src_url, size, is_voice_note}`). `download_asset` is how an MCP-only agent pulls that file's actual bytes without touching the raw Beeper Desktop API on `:23373`: reference the attachment **either** by its `src_url` (the value straight off the attachment — an `mxc://` / `localmxc://` URL, or a `file://` URL inside Beeper's media cache once the file is downloaded locally; arbitrary `file://` paths and other schemes are refused, so the tool can only reach real attachments, never the rest of the container's filesystem) **or** by `chat_id` + `message_id` (+ optional `index` to pick one of several), in which case beeperbox resolves the `src_url` and also returns the file's `file_name` / `mime_type` / `size`. The bytes come back **base64** in `data_base64` (with `content_type`, `bytes`, `encoding`). Because the payload is base64 inside the JSON-RPC result, it's capped at `BEEPERBOX_MAX_ASSET_BYTES` (default 8 MiB) — an oversized asset returns a clear error rather than a truncated file; raise the cap, or fetch `GET /v1/assets/serve?url=…` directly, for larger files. Internally `download_asset` proxies that same `serve` endpoint, so a remote/MCP-only deployment that only publishes `:23375` can still read attachments.

### Schemas the LLM learns once and reuses everywhere

```
Chat:
  id               stable chat identifier
  title            human-readable chat name
  network          machine slug ("whatsapp", "telegram", "discord", ...)
  network_label    human name ("WhatsApp", "Telegram", "Discord", ...)
  is_group         true if this is a multi-participant chat
  is_note_to_self  true if this is the user's own self chat (filtered from list_inbox)
  last_message_at  ISO 8601 timestamp of the most recent activity
  unread_count     integer
  labels           (when MCP_LABEL_ALLOW is set) array of label titles this chat carries

Message:
  id               stable message identifier
  chat_id          the chat this message belongs to (always present, no second lookup)
  network          machine slug (same as Chat)
  network_label    human name (same as Chat)
  sender           { id, name, is_self }   # is_self = sent by my account from ANY client
  text             message body (or "[MEDIA]" / "[non-text]" for non-text types)
  type             "TEXT" | "MEDIA" | ...
  attachments      array of { type, file_name, mime_type, src_url, size, is_voice_note }; [] when none
  timestamp        ISO 8601
  reply_to         parent message id if this is a reply, else null
  source           "api" if THIS beeperbox sent it (send_message/note_to_self), else "external"
  client_tag       the client_tag passed at send time, echoed back; else null
```

`source` is the echo-guard: on one account both the owner's own messages and the agent's API replies are `is_self: true`, so only `source` distinguishes "I sent this programmatically" (skip it in a poll loop) from "external" (act on it). See the [context guide](../beeperbox.context.md) for the matcher's best-effort caveats.

### Calling a tool via HTTP (from any host/language)

All calls are JSON-RPC 2.0 POST to `http://localhost:23375`. The method is always `tools/call`. Three worked examples:

**1. List your top 5 inbox chats**

```sh
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:23375 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary @- <<'EOF'
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"list_inbox","arguments":{"limit":5}}}
EOF
```

**2. Send a WhatsApp reply**

```sh
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:23375 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary @- <<'EOF'
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":2,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"send_message","arguments":{"chat_id":"!xxx:beeper.local","text":"on my way 👍"}}}
EOF
```

**3. Full-text search**

```sh
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:23375 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-binary @- <<'EOF'
{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":3,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"search_messages","arguments":{"query":"invoice","limit":10}}}
EOF
```

### Wiring an agent runtime to beeperbox

**Stdio transport (Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, bareagent)** — add to your MCP client config (e.g. `~/.claude/mcp.json` for Claude Code):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "beeperbox": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["exec", "-i", "beeperbox", "node", "/opt/mcp/server.js", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

The client spawns a fresh server process per session; stdio becomes the protocol channel and the MCP server inherits the container's `BEEPER_TOKEN` env automatically.

**HTTP transport (remote agents, web, no-code tools)** — point your client at `http://localhost:23375` (or the appropriate host/IP if you've tunneled it). No configuration needed beyond the URL — the same server handles both transports out of one file.

### Testing tools without an agent

```sh
# tools/list — see all registered tools with their schemas
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:23375 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":0,"method":"tools/list"}' \
  | python3 -m json.tool

# any tool via stdio from the host
echo '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}' \
  | docker exec -i beeperbox node /opt/mcp/server.js --stdio
```

---

## Lite mode (run without Docker)

Everything above runs Beeper Desktop **inside** the container. **Lite mode** is the other way to run beeperbox: only the MCP verb server, pointed at a Beeper Desktop **you already run** on your own machine — no Docker, no Electron, no Xvfb. It's the exact same `mcp/server.js` the container runs (identical 15 tools, identical version), just packaged as an npm bin.

Use lite mode when Beeper Desktop is already open on the machine and you want beeperbox's verb surface without the container. Use the container when there's no human/desktop in the loop (always-on, VPS, headless).

**Prereqs:** Beeper Desktop running locally, with the Developer API enabled and a token — the same [Create an access token](#create-an-access-token) steps as the container (Settings → Developers → enable the API → create a token).

**Run it:**

```sh
# HTTP transport — MCP on http://127.0.0.1:23375, pointed at the local Beeper API on :23373
BEEPER_TOKEN=your-token-here npx beeperbox

# stdio transport (Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Continue, bareagent)
BEEPER_TOKEN=your-token-here npx beeperbox --stdio
```

On boot it logs a one-line reachability verdict so a bad token or unreachable Beeper is obvious immediately, instead of surfacing at the first tool call:

```
[beeperbox-mcp] preflight OK: http://127.0.0.1:23373 reachable, token accepted, 4 account(s)
```

**Wiring an MCP client to lite mode** (e.g. `~/.claude/mcp.json` for Claude Code) — point it at the bin instead of `docker exec`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "beeperbox": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["beeperbox", "--stdio"],
      "env": { "BEEPER_TOKEN": "your-token-here" }
    }
  }
}
```

**Env contract** (all optional except `BEEPER_TOKEN`):

| Env | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `BEEPER_API` | Local Beeper Desktop API base | `http://127.0.0.1:23373` |
| `BEEPER_TOKEN` | Beeper dev token (Settings → Developers) | — (required) |
| `MCP_PORT` | MCP HTTP port | `23375` |
| `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` | Optional bearer guard on the MCP endpoint | unset (open on loopback) |
| `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Host/Origin allowlist | `localhost,127.0.0.1,::1` |
| `MCP_BIND_ADDR` | Interface the MCP server binds | `127.0.0.1` (loopback) |
| `MCP_TOOL_MODE` | Capability surface: `read-only` \| `notes` \| `labels` \| `read-write` | `read-write` (legacy `MCP_READ_ONLY=1` ⇒ `read-only`) |
| `MCP_LABEL_ALLOW` | Comma-separated Beeper label titles/ids restricting every chat-bearing verb | unset (no restriction) |

**Security:** lite mode binds **loopback only** (`127.0.0.1`) by default — safe with no auth, because only processes on your own machine can reach it. This is a *different* mechanism from the container: the container binds `0.0.0.0` and relies on Docker's `127.0.0.1` port publish as the boundary, but lite mode has no such layer, so its bind is the boundary. **Do not just set `MCP_BIND_ADDR=0.0.0.0`** to "make it reachable" — a same-network attacker can spoof the `Host` header past the allowlist and reach the full tool surface (read every message, send across every network) with no auth. To expose it deliberately, set `MCP_BIND_ADDR=0.0.0.0` **and** `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`, and front it with a tunnel (SSH / Tailscale / TLS reverse proxy).

**Supervision:** there's no Docker `restart: unless-stopped` here. For an always-on lite setup, run it under `systemd` or `pm2`.

**What lite mode is *not*:** it does not bundle or headless-run Beeper Desktop — that's the container's job. No new verbs, no transport changes. It's the same server, packaged to run standalone.

## Deploy to a VPS

Everything above works identically on a VPS. Differences:

### Pick a VPS with 1 GB+ RAM

beeperbox idles around 500 MB and peaks around 700–900 MB when Matrix sync is busy. A $5/month Hetzner/RackNerd/DigitalOcean box with 1 GB RAM is enough for beeperbox plus one small agent alongside it. A 512 MB VPS is too tight.

### Install Docker + compose plugin

```sh
# Debian/Ubuntu
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
sudo systemctl enable --now docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER   # log out/in after this
```

### Clone and start

Same as the laptop install:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hamr0/beeperbox.git
cd beeperbox
docker compose up -d
```

### Do the one-time login

You need to reach noVNC from your laptop's browser to log in. Three options, from least to most secure:

**A — SSH port-forward (recommended)**

On your laptop:

```sh
ssh -L 6080:localhost:6080 -L 23373:localhost:23373 user@vps.example.com
```

Leave this running. Open `http://localhost:6080/vnc.html` in your browser — it tunnels through SSH to the VPS. When setup is done, close the SSH tunnel. The API continues running on the VPS locally.

This is the right default: you never open extra ports on the VPS, and you only need the tunnel for the one-time setup.

**B — Tailscale / Wireguard**

Put the VPS on your private mesh, browse `http://<tailscale-ip>:6080/vnc.html` directly. Also good; slightly more setup.

**C — Expose `6080` to the public internet**

**Do not do this naively.** noVNC has no authentication by default, which means anyone who knows your IP can open Beeper Desktop, read your chats, and send messages. If you must expose it, put a reverse proxy with HTTP basic auth or a Cloudflare Access rule in front. And close the port again after setup.

### Point your agent at it

If your agent runs on the same VPS, it uses `http://localhost:23373`. If your agent runs elsewhere, you need to either:

- SSH tunnel `23373` to wherever the agent runs, or
- Put the API behind a reverse proxy with TLS + auth (nginx, Caddy, Traefik — any of them work), or
- Put the agent and the VPS on the same private network (Tailscale, Wireguard).

**The API has no TLS, no rate limiting, and no firewall of its own.** Do not expose `23373` to the public internet. The Bearer token is the only access control, and it is a single shared secret you pasted in your code.

### Reverse proxy with TLS (Caddy example)

`Caddyfile`:

```
api.example.com {
    reverse_proxy localhost:23373
    basicauth {
        beeperbox <bcrypt-hash>
    }
}
```

Caddy handles TLS certificates via Let's Encrypt automatically. Basic auth adds a second layer in front of your Bearer token.

## Ports

beeperbox publishes two host ports, both bound to `127.0.0.1` only:

| Default host port | Container port | Purpose | Override env var |
|---|---|---|---|
| `23373` | `23380` | Beeper Desktop API (via socat forwarder) | `BEEPERBOX_HOST_PORT` |
| `6080` | `6080` | noVNC web UI for first-run login | `BEEPERBOX_NOVNC_PORT` |

The defaults assume a clean host. If you're running on a dev machine that already has a **native Beeper Desktop** installed (which itself binds to `:23373`), override the API port:

```sh
BEEPERBOX_HOST_PORT=23374 docker compose up -d
```

You can put the override in a `.env` file next to `docker-compose.yml` to make it sticky:

```
BEEPERBOX_HOST_PORT=23374
```

The container's **internal** port (`23380` after the socat forwarder) never changes regardless of what you override on the host side. Container internal ports live in their own network namespace and cannot conflict with anything on the host — only the **host-side** mapping is at risk of collision. Read the [troubleshooting section on ports](#port-23373-or-6080-address-already-in-use) below if you're confused about why this works.

After starting the container, confirm which host port you actually got with:

```sh
docker port beeperbox
```

## Running multiple instances on one VPS

beeperbox is deliberately **single-tenant** — one container, one Beeper account, one set of bridges. That's because Beeper Desktop itself can only be logged in as one user at a time. If you need to serve multiple Beeper accounts (e.g. you're running beeperbox for two or three small businesses), the answer is **spawn multiple beeperbox containers on the same host, one per account**.

Each instance needs:

- A unique container name (`BEEPERBOX_CONTAINER_NAME` env var)
- A unique compose project name (`docker compose -p <project>`)
- A unique set of host ports (the three `BEEPERBOX_*_PORT` env overrides handle this)
- A unique named volume for Beeper session persistence (the project prefix handles this automatically)
- Its own `.env` file with a different `BEEPER_TOKEN`

**Create one `.env.<name>` file per instance** containing both the port overrides and that instance's Beeper token:

```
# .env.a
BEEPERBOX_CONTAINER_NAME=beeperbox-a
BEEPERBOX_HOST_PORT=23373
BEEPERBOX_NOVNC_PORT=6080
BEEPERBOX_MCP_PORT=23375
BEEPER_TOKEN=paste-customer-a-token-here
```

```
# .env.b
BEEPERBOX_CONTAINER_NAME=beeperbox-b
BEEPERBOX_HOST_PORT=23376
BEEPERBOX_NOVNC_PORT=6081
BEEPERBOX_MCP_PORT=23378
BEEPER_TOKEN=paste-customer-b-token-here
```

```
# .env.c
BEEPERBOX_CONTAINER_NAME=beeperbox-c
BEEPERBOX_HOST_PORT=23379
BEEPERBOX_NOVNC_PORT=6082
BEEPERBOX_MCP_PORT=23381
BEEPER_TOKEN=paste-customer-c-token-here
```

Then launch each instance with its own project prefix and env file:

```sh
docker compose -p beeperbox-a --env-file .env.a up -d
docker compose -p beeperbox-b --env-file .env.b up -d
docker compose -p beeperbox-c --env-file .env.c up -d
```

Do the first-run login for each instance separately through its own noVNC port (6080 for A, 6081 for B, 6082 for C).

### Resource planning

Rough per-instance footprint:

- **Idle**: ~500MB RAM, near-zero CPU
- **Active** (Matrix sync, message processing): ~800MB RAM, light CPU
- **Image**: ~1GB on disk, deduped across instances — only the first pull counts
- **Volume**: 50–300MB per instance depending on chat history volume

Density table for real VPSes:

| VPS | Cost | Instances |
|---|---|---|
| Oracle Cloud free tier (4 ARM cores, 24GB) | **free** | 20+ |
| Hetzner CAX21 (4 ARM vCPU, 8GB) | €5.39/mo | 6–8 |
| Hetzner CAX11 (2 ARM vCPU, 4GB) | €3.29/mo | 3–4 |
| DigitalOcean basic (2 vCPU, 2GB) | $12/mo | 2 |
| 1GB VPS | varies | 1 (tight) |

### Gotchas that will bite you

Real issues found while testing this pattern end-to-end:

- **`docker compose up -d` on an existing container with new env vars does nothing useful.** If you change ports or `BEEPERBOX_CONTAINER_NAME` and re-run `up -d`, compose sees the existing container and keeps it — the new settings are ignored. You must `docker compose -p <name> down` first, then `up -d`, to actually recreate with the new config.
- **`--env-file` is not the same as shell env vars.** `--env-file .env.a` sets the *container's* runtime environment (so Beeper sees `BEEPER_TOKEN`), but compose reads that same file for variable substitution *only if no shell env vars override*. The safest pattern is to put *everything* — both the port overrides and the token — in one per-instance `.env.<n>` file:
  ```
  # .env.a
  BEEPERBOX_CONTAINER_NAME=beeperbox-a
  BEEPERBOX_HOST_PORT=23373
  BEEPERBOX_NOVNC_PORT=6080
  BEEPERBOX_MCP_PORT=23375
  BEEPER_TOKEN=paste-token-for-account-a
  ```
  Then: `docker compose -p beeperbox-a --env-file .env.a up -d`. No inline shell vars needed. Compose reads `.env.a` for both substitution and runtime env.
- **Do not reuse the same `BEEPER_TOKEN` across instances.** Tokens are tied to one Beeper account; sharing them will make multiple containers see the same chats.
- **First-run login per instance.** Each new instance needs its own one-time Beeper login via its own noVNC port (6080 for A, 6081 for B, etc.). Bridge state lives on Beeper's servers, so if all instances use the same human's Beeper account, they inherit the same bridges — but each instance still needs to log in once to populate its local volume.

### Orchestration notes

- For 2–3 instances, manual `docker compose -p <name>` invocation is fine
- For 5+, a small shell script that templates `.env.<n>` + starts the compose project from a customer list keeps things sane (~30 lines)
- For 20+, use Docker Swarm or Kubernetes — at that scale you want real orchestration with health monitoring, automatic restarts, and rolling upgrades
- Never reuse the same `BEEPER_TOKEN` across instances — tokens are tied to one account, and sharing them will cause each container to see the same chats instead of separate ones

### Why "multi-tenant in one container" is not a feature

If you were expecting beeperbox to accept a Bearer token per request and route to different Beeper accounts: that is architecturally impossible. Beeper Desktop is an Electron GUI with one logged-in user. You cannot have two different WhatsApp sessions, two different iMessage sessions, or two different anything inside one Beeper Desktop process. Multi-tenant via per-request tokens would require multi-Beeper-Desktop, which would require multi-Xvfb, multi-openbox, multi-noVNC, and multi-login — at which point you might as well just run multiple containers.

Run one container per account. The compose examples above do exactly that.

## Operating it

### See logs

```sh
docker compose logs -f           # follow live
docker compose logs --tail=100   # last 100 lines
```

### Restart

```sh
docker compose restart
```

### Stop / start

```sh
docker compose down     # stop and remove the container (volume is kept)
docker compose up -d    # start fresh
```

### Check health

```sh
docker ps --filter name=beeperbox --format 'table {{.Names}}\t{{.Status}}'
```

You want to see `Up X minutes (healthy)`. If you see `(unhealthy)`, the API is not responding to `/v1/info` — see [troubleshooting](#troubleshooting).

```sh
docker inspect beeperbox --format '{{json .State.Health}}' | python3 -m json.tool
```

Gives the full health log including the last 5 probe results.

### Survive reboots

beeperbox already has `restart: unless-stopped` in `docker-compose.yml`, so the container restarts itself if Docker is running. Make sure Docker itself starts at boot:

```sh
sudo systemctl enable docker
```

Combined with Beeper's **Start API on launch** setting (see [first-run setup](#first-run-setup)), the full chain is automatic: boot → Docker → beeperbox container → Beeper Desktop → API.

## Upgrading

### Get the latest beeperbox

```sh
cd ~/beeperbox
git pull
docker compose up -d --build
```

This rebuilds the image and recreates the container. The `beeperbox_config` volume is preserved, so you stay logged in to Beeper.

### Update Beeper Desktop itself

The Dockerfile downloads the latest Beeper Desktop stable AppImage at build time. To pick up a new Beeper version, rebuild the image without cache:

```sh
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

## Troubleshooting

### `docker compose up` fails with "Cannot connect to the Docker daemon"

Docker isn't running. Start it:

```sh
sudo systemctl start docker
```

Add yourself to the docker group so you don't need sudo:

```sh
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
newgrp docker
```

### Port `23373` (or `6080`) "address already in use"

Something on your host is already bound to that port. The most common case is that you have a **native Beeper Desktop** installed on the same machine — its API also binds to `:23373`. Don't kill native Beeper; just give beeperbox a different host port via the env override (no compose edit needed):

```sh
BEEPERBOX_HOST_PORT=23374 docker compose up -d
```

For the noVNC port:

```sh
BEEPERBOX_NOVNC_PORT=16080 docker compose up -d
```

You can stack both:

```sh
BEEPERBOX_HOST_PORT=23374 BEEPERBOX_NOVNC_PORT=16080 docker compose up -d
```

Or put them in a `.env` file next to `docker-compose.yml` to make them sticky.

To check which host ports the running container actually owns:

```sh
docker port beeperbox
```

### noVNC shows "failed to connect to server"

Container probably didn't start. Check:

```sh
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail=50
```

Look for Xvfb or openbox errors. If you see Electron sandbox errors, make sure `--no-sandbox` is still in the entrypoint.

### Beeper Desktop in noVNC is a grey screen / never loads

Wait 30 seconds. Electron apps are slow to start in a container. If it stays grey past a minute, restart:

```sh
docker compose restart
```

If that still fails, check the container logs for `[SDK]` lines. No lines at all means Beeper Desktop never launched (usually a missing lib — report it as an issue).

### `curl http://localhost:23373/v1/info` returns "Connection reset by peer"

Either the socat forwarder didn't start, or Beeper's API isn't up yet. Check:

```sh
docker exec beeperbox curl -sf http://127.0.0.1:23373/v1/info > /dev/null && echo API OK || echo API DOWN
```

- If that prints `API OK`: socat is the problem. Restart the container.
- If it prints `API DOWN`: Beeper API isn't running. You probably haven't enabled it yet — go back to [first-run setup](#first-run-setup) step 3, or you forgot to turn on **Start API on launch**.

Once you have logged in and the API has come up at least once, the entrypoint **supervises** beepertexts — if it later crashes (process death, or the launcher lingering with a dead API), it is relaunched/recycled automatically, so the half-dead "MCP answers but every tool call fails" state self-heals within ~60s. Tune or disable it with `BEEPERBOX_SUPERVISE` / `BEEPERBOX_SUPERVISE_INTERVAL` / `BEEPERBOX_SUPERVISE_API_GRACE`. The supervisor never recycles before that first login (the API is down by design until you enable it).

### `401 Unauthorized` on every call except `/v1/info`

Your token is missing or wrong. Confirm:

```sh
echo $BEEPER_TOKEN
```

If empty, you didn't export it in the current shell. If set, re-create the token in Beeper Desktop settings and try again. Tokens do not rotate but they can be revoked from the same settings panel.

### Container keeps going `unhealthy`

Beeper API is down or returning errors. Inspect the probe log:

```sh
docker inspect beeperbox --format '{{json .State.Health}}' | python3 -m json.tool
```

Look at the `Output` fields of failed probes. Common cause: you haven't enabled the API at all yet, or you restarted the container without enabling **Start API on launch**.

### "no bridge event found" spam in logs

Harmless. The Matrix SDK is trying to back up message receipts that it doesn't have local events for (usually after a fresh login while history is still catching up). Ignore it.

### I want to start fresh

```sh
docker compose down -v     # -v removes the volume too — you will lose your Beeper login
docker compose up -d --build
```

## Security notes

The Beeper Desktop API is a **single-user, local-trust** surface. It was designed to be accessed from the same machine as Beeper Desktop by software you control. beeperbox does not change that — it just moves the "same machine" into a container.

Things you must do:

- **Treat the Bearer token like a password.** Do not commit it, do not paste it in chat, do not put it in a repo.
- **Do not expose port 23373 (or whichever you've remapped it to) to the public internet.** If you need remote access, use an SSH tunnel, Tailscale/Wireguard, or a reverse proxy with TLS + authentication.
- **Do not expose port 6080 (noVNC) to the public internet without auth.** noVNC has no built-in login. Anyone who can reach it can open Beeper Desktop and read your chats. Use the reverse proxy or SSH tunnel for login, and close it when done.
- **The container runs as root.** Standard for Docker development, fine on a personal VPS, not appropriate for shared hosting. If you need better isolation, run under Podman rootless or add a non-root user in the Dockerfile.
- **Beeper's own ToS applies.** You are using a real Beeper account. Automation that violates Beeper's or the underlying platforms' terms of service (spam, mass marketing, abuse) can and will get the account flagged or banned.

Things beeperbox deliberately does not do:

- Rate limiting
- Per-user permissions (there is one user — you)
- Audit logging (beyond whatever Beeper Desktop itself logs)
- Encryption at rest for the config volume

If you need those, put them in front of beeperbox (reverse proxy, governance middleware, volume encryption) — beeperbox is the messaging backend, not the security perimeter.

## Limits and caveats

- **Image size**: ~1 GB. Electron + Chromium are the bulk. Do not expect this to shrink dramatically — musl-libc Alpine builds break Chromium, and stripping X server components breaks Electron.
- **Idle RAM**: ~500 MB. Not suitable for sub-512 MB VPS plans.
- **Single user**: one Beeper account per container. If you need multiple accounts, run multiple containers with different ports and volumes.
- **Desktop API binds to the loopback interface only** inside the container. beeperbox uses `socat` to forward `0.0.0.0:23380 → 127.0.0.1:23373` so the API is reachable from the host. If Beeper ever adds a flag to bind `0.0.0.0` directly, socat will go away — it is a workaround, not a feature.
- **WhatsApp on-device bridge** sometimes logs `no bridge event found` warnings during backup. Harmless, ignore.
- **Multi-arch image**: `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64` are published from v0.3.0 onward — Raspberry Pi 4/5, Apple-silicon Docker Desktop, and Oracle Cloud's free ARM tier all pull the right variant automatically.
- **No streaming subscriptions in the API**: the Beeper Desktop API is request/response. For realtime updates you poll `/v1/chats` or hook into the Beeper Desktop MCP server (advanced).
- **Pre-1.0**. Current line is v0.8.x — the MCP tool surface, HTTP API, default ports, and `Chat`/`Message` schemas are usable but not declared stable. See [CHANGELOG.md](../CHANGELOG.md) for the versioning policy and what each bump type guarantees. Running on a personal VPS for your own agents is fine; running as a shared service is not.
