## What this is

beeperbox is a headless [Beeper Desktop](https://www.beeper.com/) in a Docker container that exposes **two things to agents**:

1. **Raw Beeper Desktop HTTP API** on `127.0.0.1:23373` — the unmodified `/v1/*` endpoints for callers who want full control.
2. **Opinionated Model Context Protocol server** on `127.0.0.1:23375` (HTTP) or stdio — 15 semantic tools, normalized `Chat` / `Message` schemas, note-to-self isolation, clean network slugs, per-instance capability modes and label scoping. Consume from Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Continue, bareagent, or any other MCP-speaking runtime.

Agents that consume beeperbox get read/write access to **every bridge the user's Beeper account has connected**: WhatsApp, iMessage, Signal, Discord, Slack, Telegram, Facebook Messenger, Instagram, LinkedIn, Google Messages, Matrix, and any future Beeper bridge. One config, every messenger.

**Who this is for:** autonomous agents running on servers, VPSes, or in containers — anywhere a human is not sitting at a Beeper Desktop GUI. If you're a laptop user with Beeper Desktop installed locally, Beeper ships its own HTTP API and MCP server natively and you do not need beeperbox.

```
docker run -d \
  -p 127.0.0.1:6080:6080 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:23373:23380 \
  -p 127.0.0.1:23375:23375 \
  -v beeperbox_config:/root/.config \
  -e BEEPER_TOKEN=<token> \
  --name beeperbox \
  ghcr.io/hamr0/beeperbox:latest
```

## Which tool do I need?

| I want to... | MCP tool |
|---|---|
| See which platforms are connected (WhatsApp, Telegram, ...) | `list_accounts` |
| See the most recently active chats | `list_inbox` |
| Find chats with unread messages | `list_unread` |
| Poll for new messages since I last looked (watch loop) | `poll_messages` |
| Read recent messages in one chat | `read_chat` |
| Fetch one chat's metadata (unread count, title, etc.) | `get_chat` |
| Send a reply or notification to a chat | `send_message` |
| Ack a message without sending a reply | `react_to_message` |
| Search all chats for a keyword | `search_messages` |
| Record a self-note that doesn't pollute the inbox | `note_to_self` |
| Move a handled chat out of the inbox | `archive_chat` |
| Propose a reply for a human to review and send (never sends) | `send_draft` |
| See the user's labels (cross-platform chat folders) | `list_labels` |
| Create/rename a label or move chats between them | `update_label` |

The raw HTTP API (`http://localhost:23373/v1/*`) exposes dozens more operations — reminders, asset upload/download, contacts, chat search, edit/delete messages, focus control, Matrix account data. Use the MCP tools for everything that has one; fall back to raw HTTP for the long tail (or the official `beeper` CLI, which wraps most of it).

## Minimal wiring: stdio transport (recommended for agent runtimes)

Stdio is the canonical MCP transport for clients that spawn the server as a subprocess. Each client gets its own fresh process with the container's env automatically inherited.

### Claude Code / Claude Desktop

Add to `~/.claude/mcp.json` (or `~/.config/claude/mcp.json`):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "beeperbox": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["exec", "-i", "beeperbox", "node", "/opt/mcp/server.js", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor / Cline / Continue

Same shape — most MCP clients expose a "command + args" config field. Use the same `docker exec -i` invocation.

### bareagent

bareagent's `src/mcp-bridge.js` auto-discovers MCP servers from standard IDE config locations and spawns them via `child_process.spawn`. Add beeperbox to `.mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "beeperbox": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": ["exec", "-i", "beeperbox", "node", "/opt/mcp/server.js", "--stdio"]
    }
  }
}
```

Then wire the bridge:

```javascript
const { Loop } = require('bare-agent');
const { createMCPBridge } = require('bare-agent/mcp');

const bridge = await createMCPBridge({ servers: ['beeperbox'] });
const loop = new Loop({ provider, system: bridge.systemContext });

try {
  await loop.run(messages, bridge.tools);
} finally {
  await bridge.close();
}
```

Tool names in bareagent are namespaced `beeperbox_*` (e.g. `beeperbox_list_inbox`). You can also pass `tools` into the `Loop` constructor instead of `run()` — either works. On first run, bareagent writes `.mcp-bridge.json` with every discovered tool set to `allow`; edit it and set unwanted tools to `deny` to restrict the surface.

## HTTP transport (remote agents, multi-tenant, web/no-code)

Same server, same protocol, different framing. POST JSON-RPC 2.0 requests to `http://localhost:23375`:

```sh
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:23375 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/call","params":{"name":"list_inbox","arguments":{"limit":5}}}'
```

Use this when the agent runs outside the beeperbox container (different host, different container, remote VPS) and cannot `docker exec`. The same code handles both transports at once — the entrypoint starts HTTP by default; stdio is only spawned on demand.

## Tool reference

All tools are called via JSON-RPC 2.0 `tools/call` with `{name, arguments}`. Required params listed — any unlisted field is optional.

### `list_accounts`

Discover which messaging platforms are connected.

**Arguments:** none.
**Returns:** array of `{account_id, network, network_label, status, user: {id, display_name}}`. `status` is the bridge's backend connection state (`"connected"`, `"connecting"`, …) — use it to tell a still-syncing account from a real one rather than treating a transient as "gone".
**Use at session start** to see which networks are reachable before making branching decisions. A `0`/short result right after a container restart or a noVNC account-add usually means Beeper is still syncing — retry shortly rather than concluding "no accounts" (beeperbox logs this to stderr and never freezes a stale account map).

### `list_inbox`

Top recently active chats. Excludes note-to-self.

**Arguments:** `{limit?: integer(1..100) = 20}`.
**Returns:** array of `Chat`.

### `list_unread`

Same as `list_inbox` but only chats where `unread_count > 0`.

**Arguments:** `{limit?: integer(1..100) = 20}`.
**Returns:** array of `Chat`.
**Primary triage tool** — call this first to see what needs attention.

### `get_chat`

Refresh one chat's metadata.

**Arguments:** `{chat_id: string}` (required).
**Returns:** `Chat`.

### `read_chat`

Fetch the most recent messages from one chat. Messages are ordered oldest-first within the page.

**Arguments:** `{chat_id: string, limit?: integer(1..100) = 20}`.
**Returns:** array of `Message`.

### `search_messages`

Full-text search across all messages in all chats. Hits include `chat_id` + `network` so no second lookup is needed to know which conversation a result belongs to.

**Arguments:** `{query: string, limit?: integer(1..100) = 20}`.
**Returns:** array of `Message`.
**Caveat:** Beeper Desktop only live-syncs the top ~20 most active chats. Older chats may not be searchable until they're pinned or scrolled into view.

### `poll_messages`

The **watch primitive** — a passive "what's new since I last looked?" feed for a poll loop. Returns every message that arrived after an opaque `cursor`, across all recent chats (or one chat if `chat_id` is given). **Read-only: it never marks anything read, never archives, never mutates** — call it as often as you like with zero side effects.

**Arguments:** `{cursor?: string, chat_id?: string, limit?: integer(1..100) = 50}`.
**Returns:** `{cursor: string, messages: Message[], has_more: boolean, seeded?: true}`.

How the loop works:

1. **Seed.** First call, omit `cursor`. You get back `{cursor, messages: [], seeded: true}` — an empty backlog and a starting cursor meaning *"from now"*. (The single most-recent existing message may surface once on the next poll — a documented seed-boundary effect, never a miss.)
2. **Poll.** Pass the cursor back. You receive only messages newer than it, oldest-first, plus a fresh cursor. Persist the new cursor.
3. **Repeat.** Sleep your chosen interval (the *policy* is yours — beeperbox only provides the *ability*), then poll again with the latest cursor.

```javascript
let cursor = (await mcp.callTool('poll_messages', {})).cursor;   // seed: from now
while (true) {
  const { cursor: next, messages, has_more } = await mcp.callTool('poll_messages', { cursor });
  cursor = next;                          // persist this to disk — it's restart-safe
  for (const m of messages) {
    if (m.source === 'api') continue;     // skip our own programmatic sends (echo-guard)
    await handle(m);                       // m.sender.is_self may be true: the owner's own Note-to-self command
  }
  if (!has_more) await sleep(POLL_INTERVAL_MS);  // has_more ⇒ poll again immediately, more is pending
}
```

**Restart-resumable.** The cursor is opaque and fully stateless server-side — save it to disk and resume across a process or container restart with no missed or duplicated messages. Same-millisecond messages are deduplicated by id, so the classic seed/poll/dedup off-by-ones don't apply.

**Includes your own messages on purpose.** `sender.is_self` may be `true` — the owner messaging themselves in Note to self is a real inbound signal (often the command channel for an assistant). **To stop an agent from answering its own sends, branch on `source`, not `is_self`** (see the Message schema below): `source: "api"` means *this* beeperbox sent it via `send_message`/`note_to_self` — skip it; `source: "external"` is everything else, the human owner's own messages included.

**Bounds (same as the rest of the API):** the inbox scan only sees Beeper's live-synced ~20 most-active chats (pin or `search_messages` for the long tail). `has_more: true` means there are *immediately fetchable* messages beyond this page — keep polling (the cursor advances) until it's `false`, then sleep. **Residual:** beeperbox fetches up to the newest 100 messages per chat per poll; if a single chat receives **more than 100** messages between two of your polls, the oldest of that burst can be missed (Beeper's messages endpoint returns only the newest N with no backward paging). Poll often enough that no chat exceeds ~100 between polls, or backfill that chat with `read_chat` / `search_messages`.

### `send_message`

Send a text message to a chat. Markdown supported.

**Arguments:** `{chat_id: string, text: string, reply_to_message_id?: string, client_tag?: string}`.
**Returns:** `{chat_id, message_id, pending_message_id, resolved, client_tag, status: "sent"}`.
**Note:** `message_id` is the **final bridge id** when beeperbox could resolve it (`resolved: true`), else the `pendingMessageID` (`resolved: false`). `pending_message_id` is always the raw pending id. Use `message_id` for downstream `react_to_message`. The resolution is what lets the echo-guard match read-backs by **exact id**, not text (see the Message schema caveat).
**`client_tag` (echo-guard):** optional idempotency/echo key. beeperbox records it against this send and echoes it back on the message — marked `source: "api"` — when it reappears in `poll_messages` / `read_chat`. Lets an agent recognize and skip its own programmatic sends without a brittle text-prefix hack (see `poll_messages` and the Message schema).

### `note_to_self`

Send a message to the bot's own Beeper-native Note to self chat. Auto-resolves the correct chat ID, so no `chat_id` parameter needed.

**Arguments:** `{text: string, client_tag?: string}`.
**Returns:** `{chat_id, message_id, pending_message_id, resolved, client_tag, status: "sent"}` — same shape as `send_message` (`message_id` is the resolved final id when `resolved: true`).
**`client_tag`:** same echo-guard semantics as `send_message` — recorded and echoed back as `source: "api"` on read-back, so a `poll_messages` loop can skip the agent's own self-notes.
**Use for:** agent self-notes ("processed 5 customer messages"), debug output, scheduled reminders, anything you want recorded but NOT seen by anyone else. The note-to-self chat is excluded from `list_inbox` / `list_unread` / `search_messages`, so messages here will not pollute customer views.

**Routing:** the resolver requires the target chat to live on the Beeper-native matrix account, so self-notes will not accidentally land in a third-party network's saved-messages chat (e.g. Telegram Saved Messages). Falls back to any single-self chat only if no matrix one exists, and writes a warning to stderr when it does — check the container logs (`docker logs beeperbox`) if you suspect routing is going to the wrong chat.

### `react_to_message`

Add an emoji reaction to a specific message.

**Arguments:** `{chat_id: string, message_id: string, emoji: string}`.
**Returns:** `{chat_id, message_id, emoji, status: "reacted"}`.
**Use for:** lightweight ack ("I saw it") without sending a full reply. Works on every supported network.

### `archive_chat`

Archive or unarchive a chat. Archived chats are removed from `list_inbox` but history is preserved.

**Arguments:** `{chat_id: string, archived?: boolean = true}`.
**Returns:** `{chat_id, archived}`.
**Note:** Beeper does not expose a `mark_as_read` endpoint. `archive_chat` is the closest primitive for the "I am done with this conversation" pattern. Pass `archived: false` to unarchive.

### `download_asset`

Download a message attachment's bytes and return them base64-encoded — the MCP-only way to reach a media/PDF/document file, without touching the raw Beeper API on `:23373`. Reference the attachment by its `src_url` (off a `Message.attachments[]` entry), or by `chat_id` + `message_id` (+ `index`) and beeperbox resolves the `src_url` and returns the file's `file_name` / `mime_type` / `size`.

**Arguments:** `{src_url?: string}` **or** `{chat_id: string, message_id: string, index?: number = 0}`.
**Returns:** `{src_url, content_type, bytes, encoding: "base64", data_base64, file_name?, mime_type?, size?}`.
**Note:** The bytes ride base64 inside the JSON-RPC result, so the asset is capped at `BEEPERBOX_MAX_ASSET_BYTES` (default 8 MiB) — an oversized file returns a clear error, not a truncated body. Internally proxies `GET /v1/assets/serve?url=…`, so a remote deployment publishing only `:23375` can still read attachments. Raise the cap or hit `serve` directly for larger files.
**Security:** `src_url` is confined to real attachments — `mxc://` / `localmxc://`, or a `file://` URL inside Beeper's media cache (`BEEPERBOX_ASSET_FILE_ROOT`, default `/root/.config/BeeperTexts/media/`); any other path, scheme, URL host, or encoded-`../` traversal is refused before the fetch. This is defense-in-depth — Beeper's own `serve` independently `403`s/`400`s those — so a caller can't turn `download_asset` into an arbitrary-file reader even if the upstream guard regresses.

### `send_draft`

Pre-fills a chat's **composer** with text via the Desktop API's draft input — the human sees it in Beeper Desktop/mobile, edits or fires or deletes it. Nothing is sent; this is the human-in-the-loop approval primitive for agents that may compose but must not send (see `MCP_TOOL_MODE=notes`).

**Arguments:** `{chat_id: string, text?: string, clear?: boolean = false, client_tag?: string}`. A new draft is only accepted while the chat's draft box is empty (Beeper-side constraint) — `clear: true` empties it first. Drafted text is recorded in the sent ledger, so if the human fires it, the read-back still tags `source: "api"`.
**Returns:** `{chat_id, action: "drafted"|"cleared", draft, sent: false, client_tag}`.

### `list_labels`

Reads the user's Beeper **labels** — private cross-platform chat folders stored as Matrix account data (`com.beeper.labels`), invisible to any contact.

**Arguments:** none.
**Returns:** `{instance_label_scope, labels: [{label_id, title, chat_count, chats: [{chat_id, in_instance_scope}]}]}` — including, when `MCP_LABEL_ALLOW` is set, which chats this instance may touch.

### `update_label`

Add chats to / remove chats from one label, create a label (unknown title + `add_chat_ids`), or rename it. Merges against the live account-data event immediately before writing (whole-event PUT, last-write-wins vs concurrent Desktop edits). Chat ids outside an active `MCP_LABEL_ALLOW` scope are refused.

**Arguments:** `{title: string, label_id?: string, add_chat_ids?: string[], remove_chat_ids?: string[], rename?: string, show_in_inbox?: boolean = true}`.
**Returns:** `{label_id, title, added, removed, chat_count}`.

## Schemas

Two normalized shapes. Learn them once and every tool returns the same thing.

### `Chat`

```json
{
  "id": "!abc123:bridge.beeper.local-whatsapp.localhost",
  "title": "Sara Smith",
  "network": "whatsapp",
  "network_label": "WhatsApp",
  "is_group": false,
  "is_note_to_self": false,
  "last_message_at": "2026-04-13T09:30:00Z",
  "unread_count": 2,
  "labels": ["Work"]
}
```

`labels` is present only when the instance runs with `MCP_LABEL_ALLOW` set (the chats it returns are pre-filtered to that scope and carry their label titles here).

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `id` | Stable opaque identifier. Pass back verbatim in subsequent calls — never construct or mutate. |
| `title` | Human-readable chat name. Use for grounding, not lookup. |
| `network` | Machine slug for branching logic (e.g. `if network === 'whatsapp'`). |
| `network_label` | Human name for UI/LLM output ("I sent that to Sara on WhatsApp"). |
| `is_group` | True for multi-participant chats. Affects addressing, tone, @mentions. |
| `is_note_to_self` | Always `false` in `list_inbox` / `list_unread` output (they filter). Use `note_to_self` tool for the self chat. |
| `last_message_at` | ISO 8601. Use for recency sorting. |
| `unread_count` | Integer. Prioritization signal. |

### `Message`

```json
{
  "id": "123",
  "chat_id": "!abc123:...",
  "network": "whatsapp",
  "network_label": "WhatsApp",
  "sender": {
    "id": "@sara:bridge.beeper.local-whatsapp.localhost",
    "name": "Sara Smith",
    "is_self": false
  },
  "text": "are we still meeting tomorrow?",
  "type": "TEXT",
  "attachments": [],
  "timestamp": "2026-04-13T09:30:00Z",
  "reply_to": null,
  "source": "external",
  "client_tag": null
}
```

| Field | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `id` | Message ID. Needed for `react_to_message`. |
| `chat_id` | Parent chat ID. **Always present on every Message**, even in `search_messages` hits — no second lookup to ground. |
| `network` / `network_label` | Same as `Chat`. Propagated so the LLM can branch per-platform without re-fetching the chat. |
| `sender.is_self` | True if the **Beeper account** sent this message — **from any client**, including the human owner typing on their phone. Distinguishes "from my account" from "from someone else". **Not an echo-guard** (see `source`). |
| `text` | Message body. For non-text messages (media, voice, etc.) this is `"[MEDIA]"` or `"[<type>]"`. |
| `type` | `"TEXT"`, `"MEDIA"`, etc. |
| `attachments` | Array of the message's files, `[]` when none. Each: `{type, file_name, mime_type, src_url, size, is_voice_note}`. `src_url` (an `mxc://` / `localmxc://` URL, or a `file://` URL inside Beeper's media cache once the file is downloaded locally) is the download reference — pass it to `download_asset` to pull the bytes. For a `MEDIA` message this is the only way to reach the file (`text` is just `"[MEDIA]"`). |
| `reply_to` | Parent message ID if this is a reply, else `null`. |
| `source` | **`"api"`** if *this* beeperbox sent the message via `send_message` / `note_to_self`; **`"external"`** otherwise. This — not `is_self` — is the echo-guard: on one account both the owner's own typed messages and the agent's API replies are `is_self: true`, so only `source` can tell "I sent this programmatically" from "the human owner sent this". Skip `source === "api"` in a poll loop; process `"external"` (the owner's own Note-to-self commands included). |
| `client_tag` | The `client_tag` passed to `send_message` / `note_to_self` for this message, echoed back, else `null`. An idempotency key the agent can correlate to a specific send. |

> **`source` matching is primarily by exact id; best-effort and unverified against a live Beeper account** (CI has none). On send, beeperbox resolves the `pendingMessageID` to the **final bridge id** Beeper assigns on ack (it GETs the message back until the id swaps) and records both, so a read-back matches by **exact id** whether or not the swap happened. A content-based fallback survives only as a last-ditch net, and **only for sends whose final id could not be resolved** — matching the account's own (`is_self`) messages in the same chat within a 15-minute window. Once a send is resolved, its text fallback is retired, so a human re-typing identical text is **not** mis-tagged as the agent's own and dropped. The ledger is persisted to the config volume so the guard survives restarts. Validate against your own account before relying on it for a high-stakes auto-responder, and keep a secondary guard if a missed echo would be costly.

## Raw `/v1/` contract (for direct-API consumers)

The MCP tools are the supported surface, but you can hit Beeper's raw `/v1/*` API on `:23373` directly (see the curl/Node/Python snippets in [docs/GUIDE.md](docs/GUIDE.md)). If you do, you are responsible for the same quirks the MCP layer absorbs for you. These are the canonical rules — match them and a raw consumer behaves identically to the MCP tools.

### Pagination floor — `?limit=N` is a *lower* bound, not an upper one

`GET /v1/chats?limit=N` and `GET /v1/chats/{chatID}/messages?limit=N` return **~25 items minimum regardless of `N`**. Asking for `limit=3` still returns ~25. The MCP layer over-fetches `max(N, 25)` then **slices to `N` client-side**; a raw consumer that trusts the count will over-read. Always slice yourself after the fetch.

### Enumerating new messages — the cursor pattern (what `poll_messages` does)

There is **no server-side cursor or `since=` param** on the raw API; it is request/response only. `poll_messages` synthesizes a cursor client-side, and a raw consumer can reproduce it exactly:

1. **Discover changed chats.** `GET /v1/chats?limit=100`, read each chat's `lastActivity` (ISO 8601). Only chats whose `lastActivity` is `>=` your last high-water timestamp can hold new messages — skip the rest.
2. **Page each candidate.** `GET /v1/chats/{chatID}/messages?limit=50` (newest-first). Keep messages whose `timestamp` is **strictly after** your cursor.
3. **Dedup same-millisecond ties by id.** Track the message ids seen *at* your high-water timestamp; a message is new iff `timestamp > cursorTs` **or** (`timestamp === cursorTs` **and** its id wasn't already seen). This is the off-by-one that bites hand-rolled pollers — without the id set, two messages in the same millisecond will drop one or replay one.
4. **Advance the cursor** to the newest `(timestamp, ids@timestamp)` you delivered. Persist it; it's restart-safe.

This is bounded by Beeper's ~20-chat live sync (step 1 only sees live-synced chats) — the same bound the MCP tools have. **Prefer the `poll_messages` MCP tool**; this is only the recipe if you're consuming raw `/v1/` and can't use MCP.

### Canonical field heuristics (raw shapes → normalized meaning)

The MCP normalizers (`Chat` / `Message`) apply these; a raw consumer must apply them too to agree:

| Concept | Raw rule |
|---|---|
| **Network** | NOT in the room id. Resolve `chat.accountID` against `GET /v1/accounts` → `account.network` (human label), then slug it. Cache the accounts map — it's stable per session. |
| **Note-to-self** | `chat.participants.total === 1 && chat.participants.items[0].isSelf === true`. Catches both Beeper-native Note to self **and** each platform's saved-messages chat (Telegram "Saved Messages", WhatsApp "Send to yourself"). `list_inbox` / `list_unread` filter these out. |
| **Group** | `chat.type === 'group'` (and not note-to-self) — there is no `isGroup` field. |
| **Last activity** | `chat.lastActivity` (camelCase ISO 8601), not `last_activity`. |
| **Message sender-is-self** | `message.isSender === true`. True for **anything the account sent from any client** — this is *not* an "I sent it via the API" signal (the MCP layer adds `source` for that, which the raw API has no equivalent of — it's a beeperbox-side ledger). |
| **Sent message id** | `POST .../messages` returns `pendingMessageID`, a local pending id that the bridge **replaces with a real id on ack**. Don't treat it as a stable delivered id; poll the chat to see the real one. |

## Network slugs

Clean lowercase identifiers the LLM can pattern-match on:

`whatsapp`, `imessage`, `telegram`, `signal`, `discord`, `slack`, `instagram`, `facebook`, `linkedin`, `gmessages`, `twitter`, `matrix`, `beeper`

Unknown networks fall back to the Beeper display name lowercased with non-alphanumerics stripped. Don't branch on `network_label` — it's human-readable and may change between Beeper versions. Branch on `network`.

## Error codes

beeperbox MCP extends the JSON-RPC 2.0 error codes with Beeper-specific codes in the `-32000` to `-32099` range.

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-32700` | JSON parse error (malformed request body) |
| `-32600` | Invalid request (missing/wrong `jsonrpc` version) |
| `-32601` | Method not found / tool not found |
| `-32602` | Invalid params (missing required arg, or wrong type) |
| `-32603` | Internal error (unhandled exception) |
| `-32000` | `BEEPER_TOKEN` not set — token missing from container env |
| `-32001` | Beeper API returned an HTTP error; the message includes the Beeper status + response body verbatim so the LLM can self-correct |
| `-32002` | Note-to-self chat not found in the top 100 chats (open Beeper Desktop and verify) |

Tool errors are returned as JSON-RPC error objects, not thrown. The LLM should read `error.message` for the actionable part.

## Auth model

- Container reads `BEEPER_TOKEN` from env at startup (typically set via `.env` file next to `docker-compose.yml`).
- MCP server forwards the token to the raw Beeper API on every call.
- **One container, one Beeper account, any number of tokens.** Each token can have its own scope (read-only or read + write), and you can revoke them individually from Beeper Desktop's Approved Connections panel.
- Token creation: **Settings → Developers → Approved Connections → +** with `expiry: never`. See [docs/GUIDE.md](docs/GUIDE.md) for the full UI walkthrough.

### MCP HTTP transport hardening

`BEEPER_TOKEN` authenticates beeperbox *to Beeper* — it is **not** a credential callers present to the MCP HTTP transport. By default the HTTP transport on `:23375` accepts any well-formed request and relies on the `127.0.0.1` publish to keep it local. Three optional env vars harden that surface (all unset = prior behavior; the stdio transport is local-only and unaffected):

| Env var | Effect | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` | When set, every HTTP request must send `Authorization: Bearer *** or get `401`. | unset (open) |
| `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Comma-separated `Host`/`Origin` allowlist. Blocks DNS-rebinding (`403` on a non-allowlisted `Host`) and cross-origin browser calls (`403` on a non-allowlisted `Origin`). Set this to your hostname when running behind a reverse proxy. | `localhost,127.0.0.1,::1,[::1]` |
| `MCP_MAX_BODY` | Max request body bytes; larger bodies abort `413`. | `1048576` (1 MiB) |
| `MCP_TOOL_MODE` | Capability surface for the instance: `read-only` \| `notes` (reads + `note_to_self`/`send_draft`) \| `labels` (reads + `update_label`) \| `read-write`. Non-selected tools are hidden from `tools/list` AND rejected in `tools/call`. Unknown mode fails closed to `read-only`. | `read-write` (legacy `MCP_READ_ONLY=1` ⇒ `read-only`) |
| `MCP_LABEL_ALLOW` | Comma-separated Beeper label titles/ids: the instance only sees and touches chats carrying one of them — listings, search hits, reads, and writes all enforce it, fail-closed if labels are unresolvable. `note_to_self` exempt. Chats gain `labels[]` when set. | unset (no restriction) |

The listener stays bound to `0.0.0.0` inside the container on purpose — a Docker published port is unreachable if the in-container process binds `127.0.0.1`. Auth + Host/Origin validation are the defense, not the bind address. For an agent that reaches the HTTP transport across hosts, set `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` and send it as a bearer header. In the container deployment, `entrypoint.sh` runs three instances against one Beeper API: `:23375` (default agent surface, mode/label-scope from `MCP_TOOL_MODE_READ` / `MCP_LABEL_ALLOW_READ`, token-gated), `:23376` (always `read-write`, loopback-only, its own sent ledger), and optionally `:23377` — a label-scoped instance for a remote or low-trust agent: mode from `MCP_TOOL_MODE_WORK`, scope from `MCP_LABEL_ALLOW_WORK`, gated by `MCP_WORK_TOKEN`, with a distinct sent ledger. The `:23377` instance is fail-closed at the launcher too: it refuses to start if the token is set without a scope (an unrestricted work instance would defeat the fence). Because scope enforcement lives in this MCP layer and not in Beeper itself, the fence holds only as long as the agent cannot read the container's env — deploy low-trust agents on a different host and hand them only the scoped token.

### Read-only vs read-write tokens

Two layers give least-privilege, and they compose:

1. **Beeper's own token scope.** The Desktop token creation UI has an **"Allow sensitive actions"** toggle that gates write operations *inside Beeper Desktop itself* — a token minted without it cannot POST sends/reactions/archives even against the raw API.

   | Token scope | Denied raw operations (HTTP `401`) |
   |---|---|
   | **Read + write** (Allow sensitive actions: **on**) | none |
   | **Read only** (Allow sensitive actions: **off**) | sending, reactions, archive, and other mutating `POST`/`PATCH`/`PUT` paths |

2. **beeperbox tool modes** (`MCP_TOOL_MODE` above) — which the *MCP surface* exposes, independent of the underlying token. A `notes` instance can draft and self-note but has no tool that could reach a third party even if the Beeper token were fully scoped.

Use both for least-privilege agents: a monitoring or summarization agent gets a mode-gated instance (and optionally a read-only Beeper token), so a prompt-injection attack cannot make it send.

### Multi-tenancy

**beeperbox is single-tenant by design** — one container, one Beeper account, period. Beeper Desktop is an Electron GUI with exactly one logged-in user; multiple accounts in one container would require multiple Beeper Desktops, which would require multiple Xvfb/openbox/noVNC stacks, which is exactly what running multiple containers gives you without inventing a new primitive.

For serving multiple accounts on one VPS, **spawn one container per account** using `docker compose -p <project>` for namespacing and the existing `BEEPERBOX_HOST_PORT` / `BEEPERBOX_NOVNC_PORT` / `BEEPERBOX_MCP_PORT` env overrides for port offset. See the "Running multiple instances on one VPS" section in [docs/GUIDE.md](docs/GUIDE.md) for the exact pattern.

Density rule of thumb: ~500MB RAM idle + ~800MB active per instance. 1GB VPS fits 1, 4GB fits 3–4, 8GB fits 6–8. Oracle Cloud's free 24GB ARM tier fits 20+.

## Gotchas

**Top ~20 active chats only.** Beeper Desktop live-syncs the top 20 or so most active chats by default. If `list_inbox` doesn't include a chat the user expects, it's probably deprioritized. Workarounds:
- Pin the chat in Beeper Desktop (via noVNC) — pinned chats stay in live sync regardless of activity
- Use `search_messages` for older history — Beeper has a separate search backend that covers more ground than the live sync

**`?limit=N` is lower-bounded.** Beeper's raw API returns ~25 items minimum from `/v1/chats` regardless of the `limit` param. beeperbox's MCP tools slice client-side to honor your requested limit — no workaround needed at the MCP layer.

**Note-to-self detection is heuristic for inbox filtering, deterministic for sending.** Inbox-side, a chat is classified as note-to-self when `participants.total === 1` AND `participants.items[0].isSelf === true` — this catches both Beeper-native Note to self and per-platform saved-messages chats (Telegram Saved Messages, WhatsApp "Send to yourself", etc.), so any single-self chat is correctly filtered out of `list_inbox` / `list_unread`. The `note_to_self` write tool is stricter: it requires the resolved chat to live on the Beeper-native matrix account so agent self-notes can't accidentally post into Telegram Saved Messages. If no matrix single-self chat exists (unusual setup), it falls back to any single-self chat rather than failing — open Beeper Desktop and verify the Beeper-native "Note to self" chat exists if you see unexpected routing.

**`send_message` returns Beeper's `pendingMessageID`.** Not a stable delivered ID. If you need confirmation the message was actually delivered (not just queued locally), poll `read_chat` for the new message — Beeper replaces the pending ID with a real one once the bridge acks.

**Stdout is reserved for the protocol in stdio mode.** If you write your own MCP client, do not log to `server.js`'s stdout — only stderr. The MCP server's own logs go to stderr automatically.

**Container rebuilds need `up -d`, not `restart`.** Environment variables (including `BEEPER_TOKEN`) are only re-read on container recreation. `docker compose restart` keeps the old env.

**`archive_chat` is not `mark_as_read`.** Beeper's API doesn't expose mark-as-read. Archiving moves a chat out of the inbox but doesn't clear the unread badge in Beeper Desktop. If an agent needs to clear unread, the honest answer is: there is no way via this API, full stop.

## Patterns

### Pattern 1: triage-and-reply loop

```javascript
const unread = await mcp.callTool('list_unread', { limit: 10 });
for (const chat of unread) {
  const messages = await mcp.callTool('read_chat', { chat_id: chat.id, limit: 5 });
  const draft = await llm.draft(messages);
  await mcp.callTool('send_message', { chat_id: chat.id, text: draft });
  await mcp.callTool('archive_chat', { chat_id: chat.id });
}
```

Triage, reply, clean up. Repeats forever as new unread arrives.

### Pattern 2: notification fan-out

```javascript
// Cron job: "CI failed on main"
const accounts = await mcp.callTool('list_accounts', {});
const reachable = accounts.filter(a => ['whatsapp', 'telegram', 'signal'].includes(a.network));

for (const acct of reachable) {
  // find the user's own primary chat on each platform (note-to-self equivalent)
  // for now: send to note_to_self on the Beeper-native account
}

await mcp.callTool('note_to_self', { text: '🔴 CI failed on main — see GitHub Actions' });
```

Sends to the Beeper-native self chat, which shows up on every connected Beeper client (phone, laptop, beeperbox).

### Pattern 3: agent self-log to command channel

```javascript
// At the end of every loop iteration
await mcp.callTool('note_to_self', {
  text: `processed ${count} messages, replied ${replied}, errors ${errors}`,
});
```

The note-to-self chat becomes the agent's persistent log, readable from any Beeper client. Filtered from `list_inbox` so it never pollutes customer views.

### Pattern 4: react-then-reply (lightweight ack)

```javascript
const messages = await mcp.callTool('read_chat', { chat_id, limit: 1 });
const latest = messages[messages.length - 1];

// Immediate ack so the sender knows we saw it
await mcp.callTool('react_to_message', {
  chat_id,
  message_id: latest.id,
  emoji: '👀',
});

// Then draft and send a real reply
const draft = await llm.draft(messages);
await mcp.callTool('send_message', { chat_id, text: draft });
```

Gives the sender immediate feedback ("seen") before the longer reply lands. Works on every bridge that supports reactions.

### Pattern 5: historical lookup with grounding

```javascript
const hits = await mcp.callTool('search_messages', {
  query: 'invoice Q3',
  limit: 10,
});

// Each hit already carries chat_id + network + network_label, so we can
// immediately tell the LLM which conversation each result came from without
// a second round-trip.
const summary = hits.map(h =>
  `[${h.network_label}] ${h.sender.name}: ${h.text}`
).join('\n');

const answer = await llm.answer('What was the agreed Q3 invoice amount?', summary);
```

No N+1 chat fetches — search returns the chat metadata inline.

### Pattern 6: passive watch loop (react to new messages)

```javascript
// Persist `cursor` to disk (e.g. a file or KV) so a restart resumes cleanly.
let cursor = loadCursor() || (await mcp.callTool('poll_messages', {})).cursor; // seed once

while (running) {
  const { cursor: next, messages, has_more } = await mcp.callTool('poll_messages', { cursor });
  cursor = next;
  saveCursor(cursor);

  for (const m of messages) {
    if (m.source === 'api') continue;             // skip our own programmatic sends — NOT is_self
    // m.sender.is_self may be true: the owner's own Note-to-self command is a real signal
    const reply = await llm.handle(m);
    if (reply) await mcp.callTool('send_message', { chat_id: m.chat_id, text: reply, client_tag: m.id });
  }

  if (!has_more) await sleep(POLL_INTERVAL_MS);    // has_more ⇒ keep polling, don't sleep yet
}
```

This replaces the hand-rolled "diff `list_inbox` against last-seen, dedup, track what I've replied to" loop with one cursor the server keeps honest. The poll interval is your call — beeperbox supplies the watch *ability*, not the cadence *policy*. Passing the inbound message id as `client_tag` on the reply makes the reply self-identifying in the next poll (it comes back `source: "api"`, so the guard skips it even if the content-match heuristic misses).

## Transport summary

| Feature | HTTP transport | Stdio transport |
|---|---|---|
| **Default?** | Yes — always on via entrypoint | No — on demand |
| **Where server lives** | Container background process on port 23375 | Spawned per-client via `docker exec -i` |
| **Auth** | Optional `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` bearer + Host/Origin allowlist (see Auth model) | Local-only; inherits container env |
| **Multi-client** | Many concurrent clients fine | One server per client process |
| **Works across hosts** | Yes (expose the port) | No (requires `docker exec`) |
| **Latency** | ~2ms local loopback | ~50ms process spawn + steady-state low |
| **Best for** | Remote agents, multi-tenant SaaS, web UIs | Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, bareagent, local single-user agents |

Both run in the same `mcp/server.js` file. The transport is picked at startup: default HTTP, `--stdio` argv flag switches to stdio. No duplicated handlers.

## Production usage

beeperbox v0.4.x is a POC → early product. Real-world usage notes:

- **Single tenant.** One Beeper account per container. For multi-tenant deployments, run one container per user with separate volumes and ports.
- **No rate limiting.** Your code is responsible for pacing. Beeper's underlying bridges have their own rate limits (WhatsApp is the strictest — expect 429s under heavy sending).
- **No message delivery guarantees.** `send_message` returns a `pendingMessageID` immediately — actual delivery depends on the bridge. Poll `read_chat` or wait a few seconds before reacting to assume success.
- **Persistent login.** The container's `/root/.config` volume holds the Beeper Desktop session. Back it up if you care about not re-logging in.
- **Restart behavior.** The compose file sets `restart: unless-stopped` + a healthcheck that probes through the socat forwarder. Process death triggers restart immediately; API hangs are caught by the healthcheck within ~100s.
- **Security.** Published ports are bound to `127.0.0.1` only by default. For remote access use SSH tunneling, Tailscale/Wireguard, or a TLS reverse proxy with auth. The MCP HTTP transport additionally validates `Host`/`Origin` (DNS-rebinding defense, always on) and can require a bearer token via `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` — set it before exposing `:23375` beyond loopback. noVNC (`:6080`) can require a password via `VNC_PASSWORD` (unset = password-less, in which case it must stay loopback-only). The container runs with `no-new-privileges` to block setuid escalation. See [docs/GUIDE.md](docs/GUIDE.md) for patterns.

Published tags: `:latest` (newest release, rebuilt weekly and **test-gated** — a build that fails the MCP/VNC guard checks is not published), `:previous` (the prior `:latest`, kept as a known-good fallback — `BEEPERBOX_IMAGE_TAG=previous` to roll back), `:X.Y.Z` (a release; note it is re-pushed by the weekly cron while it's the newest, so it is *not* immutable). For a bit-exact, frozen image, pin the **digest** (`ghcr.io/hamr0/beeperbox@sha256:…`).

Beeper Desktop is frozen at build time in the image. Rebuilding with `docker compose build --no-cache` pulls whatever Beeper Desktop is current at that moment. API schema changes in newer Beeper versions may break normalizers — open an issue if you hit one. For a reproducible, hash-verified build, pass `--build-arg BEEPER_VERSION=<ver> --build-arg BEEPER_SHA256=<sha256>`; without them the build auto-updates to the latest stable Beeper (the default).

Starting with v0.3.0, `docker pull ghcr.io/hamr0/beeperbox:latest` gives you the variant that matches your CPU architecture automatically. Supported hosts: any amd64 Linux (x86/x64) or arm64 Linux (Raspberry Pi 4/5 64-bit, Oracle Cloud Ampere A1, Hetzner CAX-series, AWS Graviton, Apple Silicon under Docker Desktop). No `linux/arm/v7` — Beeper doesn't publish a 32-bit ARM AppImage, so 32-bit Pi OS installs need to upgrade to 64-bit.
