**Plug your AI agent into 50+ messengers through a single MCP endpoint — in Docker, or as a one-line `npx`.**

WhatsApp, iMessage, Signal, Telegram, Discord, Slack, Messenger, Instagram, LinkedIn, Google Messages, Matrix — everything [Beeper](https://www.beeper.com/) bridges, reachable from one HTTP or MCP endpoint instead of 50 per-platform SDKs, OAuth dances, and rate-limit quirks. If you only need Telegram, this is overkill — use [openclaw](https://github.com/openclaw/openclaw) or any BotFather library. If you need reach across many networks from one agent, keep reading.

## Two ways to run

Same MCP server, same 15 tools, same `serverInfo.version` — by construction, because both modes run the [same single file](mcp/server.js). Pick by where Beeper lives:

| | **Container** | **Lite** (`npx`) |
|---|---|---|
| Beeper Desktop | bundled, headless, in Docker | **you** supply it (already open on your machine) |
| Needs | Docker + compose | just Node 18+ |
| Start | `docker compose up -d` | `npx beeperbox` |
| Best for | always-on, VPS, headless | laptop users with Beeper already running |
| First-run login | noVNC at `:6080` | already done in your local Beeper |

The container is the full appliance (headless Beeper + raw API + MCP). Lite mode is **just the MCP verb layer** pointed at a Beeper you already run — no Docker, no Electron, no Xvfb. New in [v0.8.0](CHANGELOG.md).

## Quick start (container)

Prereqs: Docker + compose plugin, ~1 GB disk, ~600 MB RAM, a Beeper account.

**1. Pull and run**

```sh
curl -LO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hamr0/beeperbox/master/docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

Pulls the pre-built multi-arch image (`ghcr.io/hamr0/beeperbox:latest`, `linux/amd64` + `linux/arm64`). No clone, no build. Pin a version with `BEEPERBOX_IMAGE_TAG=0.8.0 docker compose up -d`, or track master with `:edge` (may break).

**2. Log in once**

Open `http://localhost:6080/vnc.html`, sign into Beeper, then **Settings → Developers** → enable the API and create an access token. Save it:

```sh
echo "BEEPER_TOKEN=abc123..." > .env
docker compose up -d
```

Login and bridge state persist in a named volume — you won't log in again after restarts, and `docker restart` recovers cleanly (the entrypoint clears the stale display lock that used to wedge a restarted container).

**3. Talk to it**

```sh
# Raw Beeper Desktop API
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $BEEPER_TOKEN" http://localhost:23373/v1/info

# MCP server (HTTP transport)
curl -X POST http://localhost:23375 \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"jsonrpc":"2.0","id":1,"method":"tools/list"}'
```

For stdio MCP, point any MCP client at `docker exec -i beeperbox node /opt/mcp/server.js --stdio`. Works with Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Continue, [bareagent](https://github.com/hamr0/bareagent), or anything that speaks Model Context Protocol.

Done.

## Ports

| Host | Purpose | Bound to |
|---|---|---|
| `6080` | noVNC web UI — first-run login only | `127.0.0.1` |
| `23373` | Raw Beeper Desktop HTTP API | `127.0.0.1` |
| `23375` | Opinionated 15-tool MCP server | `127.0.0.1` |

All three are env-overridable (`BEEPERBOX_NOVNC_PORT`, `BEEPERBOX_HOST_PORT`, `BEEPERBOX_MCP_PORT`) so you can run multiple instances on one VPS. For remote access use SSH tunnel, Tailscale, or a TLS reverse proxy — never drop the `127.0.0.1` prefix.

## Lite mode (`npx`)

Lite mode runs only the MCP verb server against a Beeper Desktop you already run locally — no Docker, no Electron, no Xvfb. It's the same single file the container runs, so the tool surface and `serverInfo.version` are identical by construction.

**Prereqs:** Beeper Desktop running locally, with the Developer API enabled — **Settings → Developers** → enable the API and create an access token (the same token the container uses).

**Run it:**

```sh
BEEPER_TOKEN=your-token-here npx beeperbox
```

MCP HTTP server comes up on `http://127.0.0.1:23375`, pointed at the local Beeper API on `http://127.0.0.1:23373`. On boot it logs a one-line reachability verdict so a bad token or unreachable API is obvious immediately:

```
[beeperbox-mcp] preflight OK: http://127.0.0.1:23373 reachable, token accepted, 4 account(s)
```

For stdio transport (Claude Code, Cursor, Cline, Continue, bareagent), add `--stdio`:

```sh
BEEPER_TOKEN=your-token-here npx beeperbox --stdio
```

**Env contract:**

| Env | Meaning | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `BEEPER_API` | Local Beeper Desktop API base | `http://127.0.0.1:23373` |
| `BEEPER_TOKEN` | Beeper dev token (Settings → Developers) | — (required) |
| `MCP_PORT` | MCP HTTP port | `23375` |
| `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN` | Optional bearer guard on the MCP endpoint | unset (open on loopback) |
| `MCP_ALLOWED_HOSTS` | Host/Origin allowlist | `localhost,127.0.0.1,::1` |
| `MCP_BIND_ADDR` | Interface the MCP server binds | `127.0.0.1` (loopback) |
| `MCP_TOOL_MODE` | Capability surface: `read-only` \| `notes` \| `labels` \| `read-write` | `read-write` (legacy `MCP_READ_ONLY=1` ⇒ `read-only`) |
| `MCP_LABEL_ALLOW` | Comma-separated Beeper label titles/ids restricting every chat-bearing verb | unset (no restriction) |

**Security:** lite mode binds **loopback only** (`127.0.0.1`) by default, so it's safe with no auth — only processes on your machine (your agent, Claude Code) can reach it. Do **not** just flip it to `0.0.0.0`: a same-network attacker can spoof the `Host` header past the allowlist and reach the full tool surface (read every message, send across every network) unauthenticated. To expose it deliberately, set `MCP_BIND_ADDR=0.0.0.0` **and** `MCP_AUTH_TOKEN`, and front it with a tunnel (SSH / Tailscale / TLS reverse proxy) — never raw on a public interface. (The container binds `0.0.0.0` on purpose because Docker publishes it on `127.0.0.1` — that loopback *publish* is its boundary; lite mode has no such layer, which is why its *bind* is loopback.)

**Supervision:** no Docker restart policy here — for an always-on lite setup, run it under `systemd` or `pm2`.

**What lite mode is *not*:** it does not bundle or headless-run Beeper (that's the container's job). No new verbs, no transport changes — it's the same server, packaged and safe to run standalone.

## The MCP

Not a thin proxy over Beeper's raw API — an **opinionated 12-tool verb layer** built for an LLM to drive. Every tool returns one normalized `Chat` / `Message` schema (so the agent never learns a second shape), propagates `chat_id` + `network` onto every message (no second lookup to know where a hit came from), and is documented in-schema for the model. Reach across all 50+ networks; the agent never knows which bridge it's talking to.

**Read / triage**

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `list_accounts` | Which networks are connected (WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord …) — slug + label + connection `status` + display name |
| `list_inbox` | Most recently active chats, with unread counts and last-activity time |
| `list_unread` | The "what needs me right now?" view — only chats with `unread_count > 0` |
| `get_chat` | One chat's current metadata by ID |
| `read_chat` | Recent messages of a chat, chronological, normalized |
| `search_messages` | Full-text search across every chat |

**Write / act**

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `send_message` | The headline write — reply or initiate; markdown, `reply_to_message_id`, returns the new message ID |
| `note_to_self` | The agent's private command/control channel — recorded, excluded from every inbox view |
| `react_to_message` | Lightest "I saw it" — a unicode emoji, visible to the sender on every network |
| `archive_chat` | The "done with this conversation" primitive (Beeper exposes no mark-as-read) |

**Watch / reach** — the last two releases

| Tool | What it does |
|---|---|
| `poll_messages` | Read-only **watch primitive**: "what arrived since this cursor?" Seed once, persist the opaque cursor, poll with zero side effects. The cursor is **restart-safe** — survives a container/process restart with no missed or duplicated messages. Each message carries a `source` field (`"api"` for beeperbox's own sends, `"external"` otherwise) so a poll loop never answers itself. *(v0.6.0)* |
| `download_asset` | The MCP-only way to reach attachment **bytes** (base64). Every `Message` now carries `attachments[]` (`{type, file_name, mime_type, src_url, size, is_voice_note}`); fetch by `src_url` or by `chat_id`+`message_id`. Byte-capped and timeout-bounded; a defense-in-depth guard refuses `file://` paths outside Beeper's media cache. *(v0.7.0)* |

Reliable echo-suppression (`source` + the optional `client_tag` idempotency tag) means an agent on a poll loop can send *and* watch the same chat without mistaking its own messages for inbound — the wiring that lets [multis](https://github.com/hamr0/multis) drop its text-prefix hacks.

## Build from source

Only if you're hacking on the image itself or running air-gapped:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/hamr0/beeperbox.git && cd beeperbox
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
```

## Docs

- [**docs/GUIDE.md**](docs/GUIDE.md) — human walkthrough: first-run login, multi-instance VPS pattern, read-only vs read-write tokens, troubleshooting
- [**beeperbox.context.md**](beeperbox.context.md) — drop-in integration guide for AI assistants: MCP tools, schemas, wiring snippets for Claude Code / Cursor / Cline / bareagent, error codes
- [**CHANGELOG.md**](CHANGELOG.md) — version history and [versioning policy](CHANGELOG.md#versioning). tl;dr **MINOR** = new runtime behavior (new MCP tool, new architecture, new transport), **PATCH** = bug fixes + packaging + docs. `MAJOR` held at `0` until the MCP tool set and HTTP API are declared stable.

## The bare ecosystem

Local-first, composable agent infrastructure. Same API patterns throughout —
mix and match, each module works standalone.

**Core** — the brain, the gate, the memory.

- **[bareagent](https://npmjs.com/package/bare-agent)** — the think→act→observe loop. *Goal in → coordinated actions out.* Replaces LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen.
- **[bareguard](https://npmjs.com/package/bareguard)** — the single gate every action passes through. *Action in → allow / deny / ask-a-human out.* Replaces hand-rolled allowlists and scattered policy code.
- **[litectx](https://npmjs.com/package/litectx)** — tree-sitter code + memory graph with activation decay, plus lightweight context engineering (write · select · compress · isolate). *Query in → ranked context out.*

**Optional reach** — give the agent hands.

- **[barebrowse](https://npmjs.com/package/barebrowse)** — a real browser for agents. *URL in → pruned snapshot out.* Replaces Playwright, Selenium, Puppeteer.
- **[baremobile](https://npmjs.com/package/baremobile)** — Android + iOS device control. *Screen in → pruned snapshot out.* Replaces Appium, Espresso, XCUITest.
- **[beeperbox](https://github.com/hamr0/beeperbox)** — 50+ messaging networks via one MCP server (headless Beeper Desktop in Docker). *Chat in → unified message stream out.* Replaces Twilio, per-platform bot APIs.
