# ─── supervise beeper desktop ─────────────────────────────────────
# beepertexts is the one process whose death silently breaks everything: the
# MCP layer (:23375) and forwarder stay up and keep ANSWERING, but every tool
# call fails because the API (:23373) is gone — a "half-dead" container that
# looks healthy to a human while serving nothing, and never self-heals. Worse,
# the Electron launcher can linger after its API/renderer process crashes, so
# watching the top-level PID alone misses it. We supervise on BOTH signals:
# relaunch if the process dies, AND recycle it if the API stays down after we
# have seen it up.
#
# The API_WAS_UP gate is load-bearing. On first run the user has not enabled
# "Start API on launch" yet, so :23373 is down BY DESIGN until they log in via
# noVNC. Recycling beepertexts every interval in that state would make login
# impossible. So we only ever recycle-for-API-down once the API has come up at
# least once this run; a never-logged-in container just runs Beeper steadily
# and waits for the human — exactly the prior behavior.
